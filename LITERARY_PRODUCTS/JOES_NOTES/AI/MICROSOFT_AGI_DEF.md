# Microsoft's $100B AGI Definition

[Microsoft](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/misc/montreal_protocol.md) and [OpenAI](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/misc/overtime_eligibility.md) have established a novel definition of [Artificial General Intelligence](AGI.md) ([AGI](AGI.md)) based on financial metrics, setting a benchmark of $100 billion in profits as the threshold for achieving [AGI](AGI.md). This unique approach represents a significant shift from traditional cognitive-based definitions and has sparked considerable discussion within the [AI](ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE.md) community.

## Executive Summary

[Microsoft](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/misc/montreal_protocol.md) and [OpenAI](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/misc/overtime_eligibility.md)'s partnership has introduced a profit-focused benchmark for [AGI](AGI.md) achievement, moving away from conventional definitions centered on human-level cognitive capabilities. This decision has implications for both companies' strategies and has generated debate about the relationship between financial success and [artificial intelligence](ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE.md) advancement.

## Profit-Based [AGI](AGI.md) Definition

The agreement between [Microsoft](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/misc/montreal_protocol.md) and [OpenAI](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/misc/overtime_eligibility.md) marks a departure from traditional [AGI](AGI.md) concepts, which typically emphasize human-equivalent cognitive abilities across multiple domains. Instead, this new definition establishes a purely financial benchmark, focusing on the system's capacity to generate substantial profits. This approach has prompted discussions within the [AI](ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE.md) community regarding:

* The relationship between financial performance and true intelligence
* The implications of prioritizing profitability over cognitive advancement
* The broader impact on [AGI](AGI.md) development and research directions

## [OpenAI](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/misc/overtime_eligibility.md)'s Financial Challenges

[OpenAI](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/misc/overtime_eligibility.md) faces significant obstacles in reaching the $100 billion profit benchmark:

* Current Revenue Status: The company's [2023](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/ai/c3_ai.md) projected annual revenue was approximately $1 billion, primarily from [ChatGPT](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/CHATGPT.md) and [API](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/API.md) services
* Market Challenges: Intense competition in the [AI](ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE.md) market and substantial development costs
* Strategic Balance: Need to maintain equilibrium between research ambitions and sustainable growth
* Operational Considerations: Managing development costs while addressing ethical and regulatory requirements

## Partnership Dynamics

The [Microsoft](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/misc/montreal_protocol.md)-[OpenAI](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/misc/overtime_eligibility.md) partnership includes several key provisions:

* Access Limitations: [Microsoft](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/misc/montreal_protocol.md)'s access to [OpenAI](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/misc/overtime_eligibility.md)'s advanced models would be restricted once [AGI](AGI.md) is achieved
* Profit Distribution: Current arrangement allows [Microsoft](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/misc/montreal_protocol.md) and other backers to claim profits until the $100 billion threshold is met
* Timeline Implications: Given current financial projections, this arrangement could extend for a decade or more
* Governance Structure: [OpenAI](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/misc/overtime_eligibility.md)'s nonprofit board maintains authority to determine when [AGI](AGI.md) has been achieved

## [Microsoft](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/misc/montreal_protocol.md)'s [AI](ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE.md) Portfolio Expansion

[Microsoft](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/misc/montreal_protocol.md) has implemented a comprehensive [AI](ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE.md) diversification strategy:
