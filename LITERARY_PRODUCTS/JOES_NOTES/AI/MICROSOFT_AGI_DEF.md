# Microsoft's $100B AGI Definition

[Microsoft](../MISC/MANHATTAN_PROJECT.md) and [OpenAI](../MISC/NATURAL_SELECTION.md) have established a novel definition of [Artificial General Intelligence](AGI.md) ([AGI](AGI.md)) based on financial metrics, setting a benchmark of $100 billion in profits as the threshold for achieving [AGI](AGI.md). This unique approach represents a significant shift from traditional cognitive-based definitions and has sparked considerable discussion within the [AI](ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE.md) community.

## Executive Summary

[Microsoft](../MISC/MANHATTAN_PROJECT.md) and [OpenAI](../MISC/NATURAL_SELECTION.md)'s partnership has introduced a profit-focused benchmark for [AGI](AGI.md) achievement, moving away from conventional definitions centered on human-level cognitive capabilities. This decision has implications for both companies' strategies and has generated debate about the relationship between financial success and [artificial intelligence](ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE.md) advancement.

## Profit-Based [AGI](AGI.md) Definition

The agreement between [Microsoft](../MISC/MANHATTAN_PROJECT.md) and [OpenAI](../MISC/NATURAL_SELECTION.md) marks a departure from traditional [AGI](AGI.md) concepts, which typically emphasize human-equivalent cognitive abilities across multiple domains. Instead, this new definition establishes a purely financial benchmark, focusing on the system's capacity to generate substantial profits. This approach has prompted discussions within the [AI](ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE.md) community regarding:

* The relationship between financial performance and true intelligence
* The implications of prioritizing profitability over cognitive advancement
* The broader impact on [AGI](AGI.md) development and research directions

## [OpenAI](../MISC/NATURAL_SELECTION.md)'s Financial Challenges

[OpenAI](../MISC/NATURAL_SELECTION.md) faces significant obstacles in reaching the $100 billion profit benchmark:

* Current Revenue Status: The company's [2023](../../people/ricardo-hausmann.md) projected annual revenue was approximately $1 billion, primarily from [ChatGPT](../../joes_notes/CHATGPT.md) and [API](../../joes_notes/API.md) services
* Market Challenges: Intense competition in the [AI](ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE.md) market and substantial development costs
* Strategic Balance: Need to maintain equilibrium between research ambitions and sustainable growth
* Operational Considerations: Managing development costs while addressing ethical and regulatory requirements

## Partnership Dynamics

The [Microsoft](../MISC/MANHATTAN_PROJECT.md)-[OpenAI](../MISC/NATURAL_SELECTION.md) partnership includes several key provisions:

* Access Limitations: [Microsoft](../MISC/MANHATTAN_PROJECT.md)'s access to [OpenAI](../MISC/NATURAL_SELECTION.md)'s advanced models would be restricted once [AGI](AGI.md) is achieved
* Profit Distribution: Current arrangement allows [Microsoft](../MISC/MANHATTAN_PROJECT.md) and other backers to claim profits until the $100 billion threshold is met
* Timeline Implications: Given current financial projections, this arrangement could extend for a decade or more
* Governance Structure: [OpenAI](../MISC/NATURAL_SELECTION.md)'s nonprofit board maintains authority to determine when [AGI](AGI.md) has been achieved

## [Microsoft](../MISC/MANHATTAN_PROJECT.md)'s [AI](ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE.md) Portfolio Expansion

[Microsoft](../MISC/MANHATTAN_PROJECT.md) has implemented a comprehensive [AI](ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE.md) diversification strategy:

### Internal Development

* Integration of smaller in-house models like [Phi-4](../MISC/PARKER_SOLAR_PROBE.md)
* Development of customized open-weight models
* Enhancement of [Microsoft 365](../../joes_notes/MICROSOFT_365.md) [Copilot](../../joes_notes/MICROSOFT_COPILOT.md) performance

### External Investments

* Investment in approximately 27 [AI](ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE.md) startups since [2022](../../joes_notes/2022.md)
* Focus areas include [AI](ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE.md) infrastructure, tooling, and hardware
* Strategic partnerships with companies like [C3 AI](CONSUMER_AI_HARDWARE.md)
* Integration with [Microsoft Azure](../MISC/MEASURABLE_OUTCOMES.md) platform

### Strategic Benefits

* Reduced dependency on single [AI](ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE.md) providers
* More tailored solutions for enterprise customers
* Enhanced cost-effectiveness
* Broader market positioning
