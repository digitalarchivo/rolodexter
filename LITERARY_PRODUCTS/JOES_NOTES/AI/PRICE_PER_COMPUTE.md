# PRICE\_PER\_COMPUTE

This file presents a novel mathematical framework for determining the [price per compute](PRICE_PER_COMPUTE.md) using a conglomerate of computational resources that combines AI and compute utilization data analysis. We demonstrate how this pricing model directly influences the viability of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) development. Our model integrates [tokenization](../MISC/WASHINGTON_UFO_INCIDENT.md) of compute resources, [dynamic pricing](../../joes_notes/DYNAMIC_PRICING.md) mechanisms, and [AGI threshold](AGI_SURVIVAL.md) analysis to establish a comprehensive framework for compute resource valuation and its impact on AGI development.

### 1. Introduction

The [democratization of compute resources](../MISC/CONSTRUCTIVIST_THEORIES.md) is crucial for accelerating AGI development. This paper introduces a mathematical model that leverages AI-driven analysis of compute utilization data to determine optimal pricing strategies, which in turn influence AGI viability.

### 2. Tokenization of Compute Resources

Let $$R = \{r_1, r_2, ..., r_n\}$$ represent a set of compute resources, where each $$r_i$$ could be GPU hours, NPU cycles, or quantum processing units. We define a tokenization function $$T(r_i)$$ that maps each resource to a standardized token:

$$T(r_i) = \alpha_i \cdot P(r_i) + \beta_i \cdot U(r_i)$$

Where:

* $$P(r_i)$$ is the performance metric of resource $$r_i$$
* $$U(r_i)$$ is the utilization rate of resource $$r_i$$
* $$\alpha_i$$ and $$\beta_i$$ are weighting factors

### 3. Dynamic Pricing Model

We propose a dynamic pricing model that adjusts in real-time based on market conditions and resource performance:

$$PPC(t) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n T(r_i)}{C(t) \cdot D(t)}$$

Where:

* $$PPC(t)$$ is the [Price Per Compute](PRICE_PER_COMPUTE.md) at time $$t$$
* $$C(t)$$ is the total available compute capacity at time $$t$$
* $$D(t)$$ is the market demand at time $$t$$

### 4. AI-Driven Utilization Analysis

We employ an AI model to analyze compute utilization patterns and optimize pricing:

$$U_{opt}(t) = f_{AI}(H(t), M(t), S(t))$$

Where:

* $$U_{opt}(t)$$ is the optimal utilization rate
* $$H(t)$$ is historical utilization data
* $$M(t)$$ is current market conditions
* $$S(t)$$ is system performance metrics
* $$f_{AI}$$ is an AI function trained on the [Exabits Protocol](../../joes_notes/EXABITS_PROTOCOL.md) data

### 5. AGI Viability Threshold

We define an AGI viability function based on the [Price Per Compute](PRICE_PER_COMPUTE.md):

$$V_{AGI}(PPC) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{k(PPC - PPC_{threshold})}}$$

Where:

* $$V_{AGI}$$ is the AGI viability (0 to 1)
* $$PPC_{threshold}$$ is the critical price point for AGI development
* $$k$$ is a steepness parameter

### 6. Resource Federation Layer Integration

The [Resource Federation Layer (RFL)](../MISC/RESOURCE_FEDERATION_LAYER.md) optimizes resource allocation:

$$RFL_{efficiency} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n P(r_i) \cdot U_{opt}(r_i)}{\sum_{i=1}^n P(r_i)}$$

This efficiency metric is incorporated into the pricing model to reward optimal resource utilization.

### 7. Conclusion

This mathematical framework provides a robust foundation for determining [Price Per Compute](PRICE_PER_COMPUTE.md) in a way that directly influences AGI viability. By integrating AI-driven analysis, dynamic pricing, and resource optimization, we establish a model that not only democratizes access to compute resources but also accelerates the path to AGI development.
