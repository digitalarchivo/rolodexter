# AGI\_COMPUTE\_THRESHOLD

### [Price Per Compute Resource](PRICE_PER_COMPUTE.md)

The [economic threshold](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/misc/disc_shaped_ufo.md) for AGI development is heavily influenced by the cost of computational power. As the price per unit of compute decreases, it becomes more feasible for a wider range of entities to engage in AGI research and development. This aspect of the threshold can be quantified in several ways:

* [**Cost per FLOP**](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/misc/climate_neutrality.md): The price of floating-point operations per second has been steadily decreasing over time, following trends similar to [Moore's Law](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/misc/nationally_determined_contributions.md).
* [**GPU/TPU Pricing**](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/GPU_TPU_PRICING.md): The cost of high-performance hardware like GPUs and TPUs, which are crucial for AI workloads, has been becoming more affordable relative to their computational capacity.
* [**Cloud Compute Costs**](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/ai/salvatore_pais.md): The pricing of cloud-based AI services and infrastructure has been declining, making large-scale experiments more accessible.

### [Scale of Accessibility](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/SCALE_OF_ACCESSIBILITY.md)

The scale component of the threshold refers to the percentage of the human population that has access to the necessary compute resources at the target price point. This is a critical factor in [democratizing AGI development](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/misc/cost_of_living_adjustment.md) and can be measured by:

* [**Global Internet Penetration**](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/misc/fusion.md): As more people gain access to high-speed internet, the potential pool of AGI researchers and developers expands.
* [**Availability of Consumer-Grade AI Hardware**](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/misc/aaro.md): The proliferation of AI-capable hardware in consumer devices increases the potential for distributed AGI development.
* [**Education and Skill Distribution**](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/misc/disinformation.md): The number of individuals with the necessary skills to work on AGI projects is growing globally.

### Implications of This Refined Threshold Concept

1. [**Democratization of AGI Research**](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/misc/cost_of_living_adjustment.md): As the price-performance ratio of compute resources improves and becomes more widely accessible, AGI research is no longer confined to well-funded institutions or tech giants.
2. [**Distributed Development Model**](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/DISTRIBUTED_DEVELOPMENT.md): The threshold concept suggests that AGI development could become a more distributed effort, with contributions from a global network of researchers and developers.
3. [**Economic Inflection Point**](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/ECONOMIC_INFLECTION_POINT.md): There may be a critical point where the combination of low enough prices and wide enough accessibility triggers a rapid acceleration in AGI development efforts.
4. [**Regulatory Challenges**](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/REGULATORY_CHALLENGES.md): As the threshold is approached or crossed, it may become increasingly difficult to regulate or control AGI development efforts due to their decentralized nature.
5. [**Innovation Acceleration**](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/INNOVATION_ACCELERATION.md): Crossing this threshold could lead to a surge in AI innovations as more diverse perspectives and approaches are applied to the challenge of AGI.

### [Measuring Progress Towards the Threshold](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/MEASURING_PROGRESS.md)

To track progress towards this refined threshold, we might consider metrics such as:

* The percentage of the global population with access to AI-capable hardware at various price points.
* The ratio of AI compute power available in consumer devices compared to specialized research hardware.
* The number of independent AGI research projects or startups globally.
* The rate of improvement in price-performance ratios for AI-specific hardware and cloud services.

By focusing on both the economic aspect (price per compute) and the accessibility aspect (scale of availability), we gain a more comprehensive understanding of how close we are to a potential explosion in AGI development efforts. This refined threshold concept emphasizes that it's not just about raw computational power, but about the [democratization of that power](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/misc/cost_per_flop.md) across a significant portion of the global population.
