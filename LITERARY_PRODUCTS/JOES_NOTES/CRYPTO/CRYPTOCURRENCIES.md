# CRYPTOCURRENCIES

**Cryptocurrencies** are digital or virtual currencies that utilize [blockchain](../MISC/DESCI.md) and cryptographic methods for **secure, transparent**, and **decentralized** transactions. Their emergence has created new possibilities for **baking economics** directly into **protocols** and software systems, potentially simplifying payment rails and **financial infrastructure**.

***

### Historical Context

* When [**TCP/IP**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite) and [**SMTP**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol) were first developed, the internet was not initially designed with embedded financial logic or micropayment capabilities.
* As a result, **payment gateways**, **billing systems**, and third-party **credit card processors** grew into separate layers, requiring complex administration and introducing latency, fees, and security overhead.
* **Hypothesis**: If cryptocurrencies had existed at the dawn of the internet, **payment logic** could have been **“baked in”** from the start, simplifying how services and resources are monetized.

***

### Motivation: “Baking Economics” Into Protocols

1. **Unified Resource Allocation**
   * With **crypto-based protocols**, costs such as **server hosting**, **bandwidth**, and **development** can be paid directly via **built-in mechanisms** (e.g., staking, node rewards).
   * This eliminates the need for disparate billing platforms, facilitating an **all-in-one** funding model.
2. **Decentralized Governance & Funding**
   * Many **DAOs** (see [DAOs](../MISC/DAOS.md)) use [**token economics (tokenomics)**](TOKENS.md) to crowdsource capital, pay contributors, and govern project direction.
   * Embedding **incentives** at the protocol level can motivate participation, resilience, and innovation—akin to how the **natural world** uses resource flows and feedback loops for **ecosystem balance**.
3. **Resourcing, Capitalization & Financing**
   * Instead of external fundraising or ads-based revenue, protocols can mint tokens, levy small fees, or employ [**bonding curves**](../MISC/VALUATIONS.md) for continuous funding.
   * [**Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**](DEFI.md) unlocks liquidity, lending, and yield-generating strategies that further **capitalize** open-source projects or community-driven networks.

### Parallels With the Natural World

* **Biological Ecosystems**:
  * Organisms exchange energy and resources automatically (e.g., carbon dioxide for oxygen in plant-animal symbiosis), without a centralized “accounting authority.”
  * Similarly, protocols with **auto-financing** could enable **peer-to-peer** resource exchange, removing reliance on centralized entities or gatekeepers.
* **Self-Sustaining Feedback Loops**:
  * In nature, **positive and negative feedback** mechanisms maintain equilibrium.
  * Crypto protocols can embed **token supply** adjustments and **algorithmic monetary policies** (e.g., stablecoins, yield curves) to self-regulate network economics.

### Practical Implementations

1. **Micropayments in Protocol Layers**
   * **Lightning Network** for Bitcoin or **Layer-2 solutions** for Ethereum can facilitate microtransactions at near-zero cost, enabling frictionless **pay-as-you-go** models for bandwidth, storage, or API calls.
2. **In-Protocol Rewards**
   * Protocols like **Filecoin** or **Arweave** compensate nodes for providing storage services, integrating **payment** and **resource provisioning** in a single economic design.
   * This “**compute-and-earn**” model aligns usage demands with compensation for resource providers.
3. **On-Chain Markets & Exchanges**
   * **Automated Market Makers (AMMs)** ensure continuous liquidity, permitting users to buy or sell tokens at all times without traditional order books.
   * Projects that rely on usage fees (like DEX transaction fees) may feed revenue back into development or governance treasuries.

***

### Challenges & Considerations

1. **Regulatory Environment**
   * Jurisdiction-specific rules around **securities** or **token sales** can slow widespread adoption. (See [Regulatory Environments](../MISC/REGULATORY_ENVIRONMENTS.md))
2. **Volatility & Speculation**
   * While embedded economics can empower protocols, token markets can be **highly volatile**, posing risk to operational budgets reliant on token stability.
3. **Complexity for End Users**
   * Integrating payment features at the protocol level might be technically intricate, requiring user-friendly wallets, intuitive UIs, and robust **key management** to lower adoption barriers.
4. **Security & Governance Risks**
   * Smart contract exploits or flawed governance proposals could jeopardize funding and trust in a protocol’s embedded economics.

### Forward-Looking Perspectives

* As [**Web3**](../../joes_notes/WEB3.md) matures, we may witness **communication standards** that inherently include **payment logic**—an **SMTP 2.0** or **HTTP 2.0** with crypto rails for subscription and micropayment capabilities.
* **Programmable money** and **cross-chain interoperability** could expand the scope of self-sustaining networks, allowing **global, permissionless** resource exchanges and collaborative funding.
