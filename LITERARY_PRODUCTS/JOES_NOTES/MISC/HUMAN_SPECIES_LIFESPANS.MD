# HUMAN\_SPECIES\_LIFESPANS

[Homo sapiens](HOMO_SAPIENS.md) are estimated to have first appeared approximately **300,000 to 315,000 years ago**. This indicates that as of [January 2025](JANUARY_2025.md), [Homo sapiens](HOMO_SAPIENS.md) has been around for about **300,000 years**.

* The oldest known fossils attributed to [Homo sapiens](HOMO_SAPIENS.md) date to around **315,000 years ago** from [Jebel Irhoud](JEBEL_IRHDOUD.md) in [Morocco](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/MOROCCO.md), which suggests that modern humans were present in [Africa](AFRICA.md) much earlier than previously thought.
* Other significant finds include fossils from [Omo Kibish](OMO_KIBISH.md), [Ethiopia](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/ETHIOPIA.md), dated to about **195,000 years ago**, and the [Florisbad skull](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/FLORISBAD_SKULL.md) from [South Africa](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/SOUTH_AFRICA.md), dating to around **259,000 years ago**.
* The [divergence](DIVERGENCE.md) of [Homo sapiens](HOMO_SAPIENS.md) from other [hominin lineages](HOMININ_LINEAGES.md) is estimated to have occurred between **350,000 and 260,000 years ago**, supporting the idea that modern humans emerged as a distinct species during this timeframe.
* **Total Number of Homo sapiens Who Have Ever Lived:** It is estimated that over **100 billion** individuals of [Homo sapiens](HOMO_SAPIENS.md) have lived and died up to [January 2025](JANUARY_2025.md). This estimate takes into account the long history of our species and the exponential growth in population over recent millennia.
