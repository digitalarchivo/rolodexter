- **Applications**:
  - **Education**: Immersive training simulations for complex tasks like piloting aircraft or surgical procedures.
  - **Entertainment**: Interactive storytelling and gaming experiences.

### **3. Mixed Reality (MR)**
- **Interacting with Both Real and Virtual Elements**: MR allows digital objects to coexist and interact with the physical world, enabling more dynamic and realistic interactions.
- **Applications**:
  - **Collaboration**: Virtual collaboration tools where remote users interact with physical and digital elements in shared environments.
  - **Engineering**: Simulating prototypes in real-world contexts for design validation.

### **4. Spatial Computing**
- **Understanding Spatial Contexts**: Spatial computing integrates spatial awareness into digital systems, allowing devices to understand and respond to the physical world.
- **Applications**:
  - **Smart Cities**: Real-time management of urban infrastructure using spatial data.
  - **Autonomous Systems**: Navigation and interaction in real-world environments for drones and robots.
