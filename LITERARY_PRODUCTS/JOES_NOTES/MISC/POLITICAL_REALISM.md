# Political Realism

## Overview

[Political realism](POLITICAL_REALISM.md), also known as [realpolitik](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/REALPOLITIK.md) in its practical application, represents a school of thought in [international relations](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/INTERNATIONAL_RELATIONS.md) that emphasizes power, national interests, and security as the primary drivers of state behavior. This framework views international politics as inherently competitive and conflict-prone, with war being a natural consequence of the anarchic international system.
