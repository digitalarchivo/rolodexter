# Military Science

## Overview

[Military Science](MILITARY_SCIENCE.md) is the systematic study of [warfare](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/WARFARE.md), military strategies, and the relationship between armed conflict and other aspects of human society, particularly economics. This field integrates various disciplines including [strategic studies](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/STRATEGIC_STUDIES.md), [military history](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/MILITARY_HISTORY.md), and [defense economics](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/DEFENSE_ECONOMICS.md).
