# Scientific and Technological Expectations for January 2025

Several significant scientific and technological developments are projected or scheduled for January 2025:

## International Year of Quantum Science and Technology

The [United Nations](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/strategy/economics.md) has declared 2025 as the [International Year of Quantum Science and Technology (IYQ)](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/misc/john_tyndall.md). This year-long initiative will kick off in January, celebrating the impacts of [quantum science](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/QUANTUM_SCIENCE.md) on technology, culture, and our understanding of the natural world. It marks a century since foundational developments in [quantum mechanics](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/QUANTUM_MECHANICS.md) and aims to strengthen national capacities in basic sciences and science education.

## Space Exploration

[NASA's](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/misc/nation_state.md) [Parker Solar Probe](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/misc/phi4.md) is expected to transmit detailed telemetry data on January 1, 2025, following its passage through the [Sun's corona](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/SOLAR_CORONA.md). This data will provide unprecedented insights into [solar physics](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/SOLAR_PHYSICS.md) and [space weather](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/SPACE_WEATHER.md).

## Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2025

[CES 2025](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/misc/aatip.md), one of the world's largest and most influential technology events, is scheduled for January 7-10, 2025, in [Las Vegas, Nevada](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/misc/lifestyle_factors.md). This event typically showcases cutting-edge innovations across various tech sectors.

## Medical Advancements

The [U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/misc/evolutionary_leap.md) is expected to complete a review of [suzetrigine](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/misc/washington_ufo_incident.md), a non-opioid painkiller, in January 2025. If approved, it would be part of the first new class of drugs to treat acute pain in more than 20 years.

## Scientific Conferences

Several important scientific conferences are scheduled for January 2025:

1. [Advanced Therapies Week 2025](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/ai/cross_domain_integration.md) (January 20-23, 2025, in [Dallas, Texas](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/misc/consciousness.md))
2. [Translating Targeted Therapies in Combination with Radiotherapy](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/physics/quantum_vacuum.md) (January 26-29, 2025, in [San Diego, California](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/SAN_DIEGO.md))

These conferences will likely showcase the latest advancements in their respective fields.

## Emerging Technological Trends

While not specific to January, several technological trends are expected to gain momentum in 2025:

1. [CRISPR](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/misc/cloud_providers.md) therapeutics pipeline is projected to accelerate, with potential breakthroughs in [gene editing](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/GENE_EDITING.md) for various diseases.
2. [Solid-state battery](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/misc/technological_cognitive_development.md) innovations are expected to boost lithium advances, potentially revolutionizing energy storage.
3. [Quantum computing](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/misc/renewable_energy.md) is anticipated to make significant strides, with potential applications in [drug discovery](../../../literary_products/joes_notes/misc/desci_organizations.md), agriculture, and weather forecasting.

These developments highlight the rapid pace of scientific and technological progress expected in various fields as we enter 2025.
