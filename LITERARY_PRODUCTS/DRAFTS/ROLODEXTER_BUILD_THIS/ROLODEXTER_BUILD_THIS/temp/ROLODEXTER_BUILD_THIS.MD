Let's create a terminal simulation that will be used for a video demonstration and mockup. 

In the simulation, the terminal console should display a homescreen, and run through the process of both the system, rolodexter, and the user, Joe Maristela. For the login simulation, use username, JoeMaristela, and use password: rolodexter. Password should be hidden with * after every correctly typed key. 

Then rolodexter, the system, should greet Joe in a chat sequence: 

rolodexter: Hello Joe! How was your 11 AM meeting? 
Joe: It was okay, I've updated some notes and sent them to you. 
rolodexter: Yes, I'm already synthesizing and have some questions for you about that. 
Joe: Okay, great. Let's go over that later though. Right now, I need you to set up an MVP of NOMIX. I've updated a few things about the system, pertaining to Solana transactions. 
rolodexter: Got it. Please respond to pending Jira issues posted about NOMIX schema, and I'll spin this up on a local server right away. Do you want me to deploy to a temp Vercel workspace as well? 
[When "Jira issues" is mentioned, it becomes an interactive link that Joe clicks, opening a preview window showing:
NOMIX-123 (High): Update Solana Transaction Schema
- Add support for SPL token transfers
- Include program invocation context
- Update signature verification process

NOMIX-124 (Medium): Implement Schema Validation
- Create validation rules for new fields
- Implement error handling]

Joe: Sure, yes, I won't have access to ParkHealth later, so Vercel would be great. 
rolodexter: Got it, see you in a bit.
