# ROLODEXTER_BUILD_THIS

## Project Overview
ROLODEXTER_BUILD_THIS is a terminal simulation project that recreates a key scene where Joe Maristela interacts with the rolodexter system. The simulation depicts Joe's first encounter with the AI-powered personal relationship management system, showing how he discovers and explores its capabilities to help manage his connections and relationships.

The simulation showcases:
- Joe's initial login and authentication process
- His discovery of the system's relationship tracking features
- Interactive dialogue between Joe and the rolodexter AI
- Demonstration of how rolodexter helps analyze and manage personal relationships
- Key commands and interactions that represent the system's core functionality

This project serves as both a technical demonstration and a narrative device, helping readers understand the rolodexter system through Joe's perspective.
