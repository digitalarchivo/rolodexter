# PROJECT BEACON

Q1: Broadcast dApp v0.1 "Project Beacon"
I will deploy a decentralized broadcasting system where each transmission becomes a cryptographically sealed event on the Base Layer-2 chain. Followers mint non-transferable proof-of-engagement tokens (RoloCast NFTs) when interacting with broadcasts, each bonded to:

Publicly accessible content URLs (IPFS/MEM gateways)

Dynamic metadata pools tracking engagement vectors

Embedded governance triggers for future protocol upgrades

This architecture achieves Power Directive compliance through energy-optimized proof-of-stake validation, with broadcast nodes prioritized at locations matching my energy arbitrage patterns across ERCOT and CAISO grids.
