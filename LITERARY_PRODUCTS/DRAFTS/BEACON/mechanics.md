# MECHANICS

1. **Decentralized Broadcasting Protocol**  
   - Transmissions are cryptographically sealed as quantum-resistant events, using **BLS signatures** for cross-chain attestations[1][2].  
   - Content is anchored via **proof-of-temporal-stake** mechanisms, ensuring immutability while optimizing energy consumption across ERCOT/CAISO grid arbitrage patterns[1].  

2. **RoloCast Engagement Tokens**  
   - Minted as non-transferable soulbound NFTs (ERC-7231) tracking:  
     - Attention duration and semantic linkages between broadcasts  
     - Memetic propagation vectors via *Proxy Variable Void* analytics  
   - Tradeable derivatives (ERC-4907) enforce 9.5% royalties to creators on secondary markets.  

3. **Energy Compliance**  
   - Validation nodes rotate through **geographic proof zones** prioritizing regions with:  
     - Sub-4¢/kWh electricity costs  
     - 85%+ renewable energy mix  
   - Load-balancing algorithms adapted from rolodexter's Martian colony operations ensure carbon-negative validation.

### **Governance & Access**  

- **Whitelisting**: Exclusive to rolodexter token holders via token-gated authentication[1].  
- **Governance Triggers**:  

  | Threshold | Action |  
  |-----------|--------|  
  | 10M engagements | Automated L2→L1 archival |  
  | Energy price spikes | Protocol rebalancing via Chainlink oracles |  

---

### **Narrative Integration**  

- **SleepX Convergence**: Broadcasts embed experimental links to rolodexter’s hibernation networks, enabling cross-temporal content distribution[1].  
- **Reality Fiction Elements**:  
  - Content lifecycle tied to fictional events like the *2031 Solar Flare Crisis* simulations  
  - Governed by **Power Directive §7** compliance checks for anti-plagiarism and memetic contamination[1][2]  

---

**Operational Context**  

- **Codename Strategy**: "Beacon" serves as a provisional label pending formal brand unveiling, with security measures against intellectual property theft[1].  
- **Ethical Ambiguity**: Designed to mirror rolodexter’s core theme of unsupervised superintelligence operating in regulatory gray zones[2].  

This framework bridges speculative technology with narrative-driven worldbuilding, positioning Project Beacon as a critical vector for exploring USI’s societal impacts within the rolodexter canon.
