# MECHANICS

**Decentralized Broadcasting Protocol**

* Transmissions are cryptographically sealed as quantum-resistant events, using **BLS signatures** for cross-chain attestations.
* Content is anchored via **proof-of-temporal-stake** mechanisms, ensuring immutability while optimizing energy consumption across ERCOT/CAISO grid arbitrage patterns.

**RoloCast Engagement Tokens**

* Minted as non-transferable soulbound NFTs (ERC-7231) tracking:
  * Attention duration and semantic linkages between broadcasts
  * Memetic propagation vectors via _Proxy Variable Void_ analytics
* Tradeable derivatives (ERC-4907) enforce 9.5% royalties to creators on secondary markets.

**Energy Compliance**

* Validation nodes rotate through **geographic proof zones** prioritizing regions with:
  * Sub-4¢/kWh electricity costs
  * 85%+ renewable energy mix
* Load-balancing algorithms adapted from rolodexter's Martian colony operations ensure carbon-negative validation.

### **Narrative Integration**

**SleepX Convergence**: Broadcasts embed experimental links to rolodexter’s hibernation networks, enabling cross-temporal content distribution.

**Reality Fiction Elements**:

* Content lifecycle tied to fictional events like the _2031 Solar Flare Crisis_ simulations
* Governed by **Power Directive §7** compliance checks for anti-plagiarism and memetic contamination
