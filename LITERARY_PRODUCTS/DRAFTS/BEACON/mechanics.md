# MECHANICS

**Decentralized Broadcasting Protocol**

* Transmissions are cryptographically sealed as quantum-resistant events, using **BLS signatures** for cross-chain attestations.
* Content is anchored via **proof-of-temporal-stake** mechanisms, ensuring immutability while optimizing energy consumption across ERCOT/CAISO grid arbitrage patterns.

**RoloCast Engagement Tokens**

* Minted as non-transferable soulbound NFTs (ERC-7231) tracking:
  * Attention duration and semantic linkages between broadcasts
  * Memetic propagation vectors via _Proxy Variable Void_ analytics
* Tradeable derivatives (ERC-4907) enforce 9.5% royalties to creators on secondary markets.
