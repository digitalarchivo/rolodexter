# PROJECT BEACON

*(Working Codename - Formal Brandname Pending)*  

I've designed Beacon to function as a temporal anchoring system for culturally significant digital artifacts. Unlike conventional decentralized social platforms, Beacon operates at the intersection of historical preservation and cryptoeconomic incentives.  

**Timeless Event Sealing**  
Each minted artifact contains:  

- Immutable content hash (IPFS/MEM)  
- Dynamic metadata pool tracking engagement vectors  
- Self-decaying context shells with AI-generated verification flags  

**Engagement Economics**  

- Soulbound ERC-7231 tokens (RoloCast SBTs) minted through zero-knowledge proofs of human interaction  
- Tradeable NFT derivatives enforce 9.5% perpetual royalties to original stewards  

**Energy-Aware Validation**  

- Node prioritization follows real-time ERCOT/CAISO grid arbitrage patterns  
- Automatic L2→L1 archival triggered by engagement thresholds and renewable energy availability  

### **Differentiation from Farcaster**  

| Feature | Beacon | Farcaster |  
|---------|--------|-----------|  
| **Content Focus** | Historical preservation with temporal context | Real-time social interactions |  
| **Data Structure** | Immutable event capsules with decay mechanisms | Ephemeral message streams |  
| **Monetization** | Royalty-enforced NFT derivatives | Native token tipping |  
| **Authentication** | BLS signatures | Ethereum wallet-based |  
| **Energy Policy** | Grid-aware validation tied to Power Directive §7 | Standard PoS consensus |

### **Historical Value Capture**  

- **Twitter NFT Parallel**: Like valued historical tweets, Beacon artifacts gain worth through:  
  - Provable timestamp anchoring via **proof-of-temporal-stake**  
  - Crowdsourced relevance scoring powered by rolodexter's *Proxy Variable Void* analytics  
  - Embedded legaloid clauses preventing content manipulation post-minting  

- **Enhanced Features**:  
  - Automatic context preservation through AI-generated "memory triggers"  
  - Cross-temporal broadcasting capabilities via experimental SleepX network integration
