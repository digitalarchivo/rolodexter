## Overview

rolodexter LARP (Live Artifact Reality Processing) is a real-time world building engine powered by Reality Fiction data architecture. It transforms real-world artifacts into dynamic, interconnected narrative universes and multimedia experiences. By processing real-world data streams (emails, documents, communications), LARP continuously evolves and expands its generated worlds while maintaining coherent narrative structures across multiple media formats.

## Reality Fiction Architecture

### Data Structure
- Reality-narrative mapping
- Temporal stream processing
- Multi-dimensional story graphs
- World state management
- Narrative coherence validation
