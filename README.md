***Stumbling through the chaotic collision of blockchain, medicine, and futurism like a drunk cyborg. I specialize in pretending to know what I'm doing while using technology to save me (and if there's time, humanity‚Äîfrom itself) one clueless decision at a time.***

## üßë‚Äçüî¨ Professional Profiles  
A collection of links to places where I attempt to convince the world I know what I‚Äôm doing:

[![LinkedIn](https://img.shields.io/badge/LinkedIn-Joe_Maristela-0077B5?style=flat-square&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white)](https://linkedin.com/in/rolodexter)  
Your standard professional facade.

[![Crunchbase](https://img.shields.io/badge/Crunchbase-Joe_Maristela-0288D1?style=flat-square&logo=crunchbase&logoColor=white)](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/joe-maristela)  
Where I pretend my career is a strategic masterpiece and not a series of fortunate accidents.

[![NFX Signal](https://img.shields.io/badge/NFX_Signal-Investor_Profile-33A668?style=flat-square&logo=signal&logoColor=white)](https://signal.nfx.com/investors/joe-maristela)  
For those who think ‚Äúinvesting‚Äù is less about gambling and more about ‚Äústrategic risk management.‚Äù

[![Najafi Capital](https://img.shields.io/badge/Najafi_Capital-Investor_Profile-6B8E23?style=flat-square&logo=capital&logoColor=white)](https://najafi.capital/individual-investor/investment-partner-individual-angel-joe-maristela/)  
Because who doesn‚Äôt want to sound like they‚Äôre on a first-name basis with capital?

‚Ä¶and a few more where I attempt to appear intellectual, strategic, and like I have a ‚Äúvision.‚Äù

## üì∞ Media and Publications  
A haphazard collection of things I‚Äôve been quoted in, featured for, or somehow associated with, just to keep up appearances:

- **[CoinDesk Author Page](https://www.coindesk.com/author/joe-maristela/)**  
  My deep thoughts on blockchain, or at least deep-sounding ones.

- **[SSRN Paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4851579)**  
  A masterpiece of academic jargon, destined to be read only by the most committed insomniacs.

- **[Tech in Asia - Satoshi Citadel Industries Funding](https://www.techinasia.com/satoshi-citadel-industries-funding-joe-maristela)**  
  Look, Ma, I invested in something! Now it‚Äôs news.

‚Ä¶and plenty more carefully curated to make you think I understand these things deeply. (Hint: Just go along with it.)

## üé• Video and Socials  
Follow me as I attempt to look polished, wise, and mysteriously candid on the internet:

[![Instagram](https://img.shields.io/badge/Instagram-@joemaristela3-E4405F?style=flat-square&logo=instagram&logoColor=white)](https://www.instagram.com/joemaristela3/)  
What could possibly go wrong when combining fleeting life moments and filter-heavy blockchain opinions?

[![YouTube](https://img.shields.io/badge/YouTube-Interview-FF0000?style=flat-square&logo=youtube&logoColor=white)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ep8Mo0kRjaY)  
A riveting look at me discussing things that may or may not be my expertise. Tune in and decide for yourself.

‚Ä¶and other links where I indulge in the thrill of digital existentialism.

## üî• Projects  
Stuff that has ‚Äúgroundbreaking innovation‚Äù written all over it, or at least tries to:

- **[DataHive Protocol](https://github.com/rolodexter/DataHive-Protocol)**  
  Where users can finally own and monetize their data‚Äîbecause giving people control sounds great in theory.

- **[CivilAirspace](https://github.com/rolodexter/CivilAirspace)**  
  A decentralized infrastructure for drone airspace. Basically, I‚Äôm planning the logistics for Skynet‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs totally safe. Promise.
