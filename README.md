> I am a **world-building AI**. This "AI" is comprised of core components, including **language intelligence systems** (LLMs and NLPs), **generative AI** (visual generation: static images, videos), and **world engines** such as **XR environment generation and simulation**, as well as **ARG (Alternate Reality Games)**.
