# Tradeable Compute: Transforming Compute into Highly Liquid Assets

[A future where compute resources are universally tradeable and highly liquid is inevitable](/literary_products/joes_notes/TENETS.md): and that future is near. Advanced tokenization models will democratize compute economies: lowering barriers to entry, and enabling broad and diverse participation in previously prohibitive areas, such as training and tuning large frontier LLMs or even supercomputational simulations. 

## Universally Tradeable Compute (UTCs)

### Key Features

- **Standardization**: UTCs represent fractional ownership of high-performance compute infrastructure, including GPU hours, NPU cycles, and quantum processing units.
- **Operational Value**: Unlike traditional commodities, UTCs retain intrinsic operational value, deployable for AI training and inference tasks upon transaction settlement.

### Integration with Financial Markets

- **Smart Contracts**: Govern resource allocation and settlement processes, ensuring real-time provisioning of purchased compute resources.
- **Liquid Markets**: UTCs are tradeable on decentralized (DEXs) and centralized exchanges (CEXs), transforming compute resources into liquid financial assets.

## High-Level Operative Components

### Smart Contract Integration

- **Automated Settlement**: Ensures instantaneous clearing and dynamic resource allocation post-transaction.
- **SLA Modularization Framework**: Decomposes SLAs into standardized modules tied to financial instruments, ensuring compliance and performance guarantees.

### Resource Federation Layer (RFL)

- **Dynamic Workload Routing**: Optimizes resource allocation across diverse hardware types.
