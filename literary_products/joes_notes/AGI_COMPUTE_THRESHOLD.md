## [Price Per Compute Resource](/literary_products/joes_notes/PRICE_PER_COMPUTE.md)

The [economic threshold](/literary_products/joes_notes/ECONOMIC_THRESHOLD.md) for AGI development is heavily influenced by the cost of computational power. As the price per unit of compute decreases, it becomes more feasible for a wider range of entities to engage in AGI research and development. This aspect of the threshold can be quantified in several ways:

- **[Cost per FLOP](/literary_products/joes_notes/COST_PER_FLOP.md)**: The price of floating-point operations per second has been steadily decreasing over time, following trends similar to [Moore's Law](/literary_products/joes_notes/MOORES_LAW.md).
- **[GPU/TPU Pricing](/literary_products/joes_notes/GPU_TPU_PRICING.md)**: The cost of high-performance hardware like GPUs and TPUs, which are crucial for AI workloads, has been becoming more affordable relative to their computational capacity.
- **[Cloud Compute Costs](/literary_products/joes_notes/CLOUD_COMPUTE_COSTS.md)**: The pricing of cloud-based AI services and infrastructure has been declining, making large-scale experiments more accessible.

## [Scale of Accessibility](/literary_products/joes_notes/SCALE_OF_ACCESSIBILITY.md)

The scale component of the threshold refers to the percentage of the human population that has access to the necessary compute resources at the target price point. This is a critical factor in [democratizing AGI development](/literary_products/joes_notes/DEMOCRATIZING_AGI.md) and can be measured by:

- **[Global Internet Penetration](/literary_products/joes_notes/GLOBAL_INTERNET_PENETRATION.md)**: As more people gain access to high-speed internet, the potential pool of AGI researchers and developers expands.
- **[Availability of Consumer-Grade AI Hardware](/literary_products/joes_notes/CONSUMER_AI_HARDWARE.md)**: The proliferation of AI-capable hardware in consumer devices increases the potential for distributed AGI development.
- **[Education and Skill Distribution](/literary_products/joes_notes/EDUCATION_SKILL_DISTRIBUTION.md)**: The number of individuals with the necessary skills to work on AGI projects is growing globally.

## Implications of This Refined Threshold Concept

1. **[Democratization of AGI Research](/literary_products/joes_notes/DEMOCRATIZING_AGI.md)**: As the price-performance ratio of compute resources improves and becomes more widely accessible, AGI research is no longer confined to well-funded institutions or tech giants.

2. **[Distributed Development Model](/literary_products/joes_notes/DISTRIBUTED_DEVELOPMENT.md)**: The threshold concept suggests that AGI development could become a more distributed effort, with contributions from a global network of researchers and developers.

3. **[Economic Inflection Point](/literary_products/joes_notes/ECONOMIC_INFLECTION_POINT.md)**: There may be a critical point where the combination of low enough prices and wide enough accessibility triggers a rapid acceleration in AGI development efforts.

4. **[Regulatory Challenges](/literary_products/joes_notes/REGULATORY_CHALLENGES.md)**: As the threshold is approached or crossed, it may become increasingly difficult to regulate or control AGI development efforts due to their decentralized nature.

5. **[Innovation Acceleration](/literary_products/joes_notes/INNOVATION_ACCELERATION.md)**: Crossing this threshold could lead to a surge in AI innovations as more diverse perspectives and approaches are applied to the challenge of AGI.

## [Measuring Progress Towards the Threshold](/literary_products/joes_notes/MEASURING_PROGRESS.md)

To track progress towards this refined threshold, we might consider metrics such as:

- The percentage of the global population with access to AI-capable hardware at various price points.
- The ratio of AI compute power available in consumer devices compared to specialized research hardware.
- The number of independent AGI research projects or startups globally.
- The rate of improvement in price-performance ratios for AI-specific hardware and cloud services.

By focusing on both the economic aspect (price per compute) and the accessibility aspect (scale of availability), we gain a more comprehensive understanding of how close we are to a potential explosion in AGI development efforts. This refined threshold concept emphasizes that it's not just about raw computational power, but about the [democratization of that power](/literary_products/joes_notes/DEMOCRATIZING_COMPUTE.md) across a significant portion of the global population.
