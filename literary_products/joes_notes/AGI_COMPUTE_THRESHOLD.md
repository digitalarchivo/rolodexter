## Price Per Compute Resource

The economic threshold for AGI development is heavily influenced by the cost of computational power. As the price per unit of compute decreases, it becomes more feasible for a wider range of entities to engage in AGI research and development. This aspect of the threshold can be quantified in several ways:

- **Cost per FLOP**: The price of floating-point operations per second has been steadily decreasing over time, following trends similar to Moore's Law.
- **GPU/TPU Pricing**: The cost of high-performance hardware like GPUs and TPUs, which are crucial for AI workloads, has been becoming more affordable relative to their computational capacity.
- **Cloud Compute Costs**: The pricing of cloud-based AI services and infrastructure has been declining, making large-scale experiments more accessible.

## Scale of Accessibility

The scale component of the threshold refers to the percentage of the human population that has access to the necessary compute resources at the target price point. This is a critical factor in democratizing AGI development and can be measured by:

- **Global Internet Penetration**: As more people gain access to high-speed internet, the potential pool of AGI researchers and developers expands.
- **Availability of Consumer-Grade AI Hardware**: The proliferation of AI-capable hardware in consumer devices increases the potential for distributed AGI development.
- **Education and Skill Distribution**: The number of individuals with the necessary skills to work on AGI projects is growing globally.

## Implications of This Refined Threshold Concept

1. **Democratization of AGI Research**: As the price-performance ratio of compute resources improves and becomes more widely accessible, AGI research is no longer confined to well-funded institutions or tech giants.

2. **Distributed Development Model**: The threshold concept suggests that AGI development could become a more distributed effort, with contributions from a global network of researchers and developers.

3. **Economic Inflection Point**: There may be a critical point where the combination of low enough prices and wide enough accessibility triggers a rapid acceleration in AGI development efforts.

4. **Regulatory Challenges**: As the threshold is approached or crossed, it may become increasingly difficult to regulate or control AGI development efforts due to their decentralized nature.

5. **Innovation Acceleration**: Crossing this threshold could lead to a surge in AI innovations as more diverse perspectives and approaches are applied to the challenge of AGI.

## Measuring Progress Towards the Threshold

To track progress towards this refined threshold, we might consider metrics such as:

- The percentage of the global population with access to AI-capable hardware at various price points.
- The ratio of AI compute power available in consumer devices compared to specialized research hardware.
- The number of independent AGI research projects or startups globally.
- The rate of improvement in price-performance ratios for AI-specific hardware and cloud services.

By focusing on both the economic aspect (price per compute) and the accessibility aspect (scale of availability), we gain a more comprehensive understanding of how close we are to a potential explosion in AGI development efforts. This refined threshold concept emphasizes that it's not just about raw computational power, but about the democratization of that power across a significant portion of the global population.
