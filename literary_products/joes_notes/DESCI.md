**Decentralized Science (DeSci)** refers to the application of [blockchain](/literary_products/joes_notes/CRYPTOCURRENCIES.md) and decentralized technologies—such as [smart contracts](/literary_products/joes_notes/SMART_CONTRACTS.md), [decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs)](/literary_products/joes_notes/DAOS.md), and [tokenized incentive structures](/literary_products/joes_notes/TOKENS.md)—to various stages of scientific research. This includes funding, experimentation, data sharing, peer review, and publication.

DeSci aims to:
- Remove [siloed](/literary_products/joes_notes/SILOS.md) barriers in the traditional scientific process.
- Leverage [open-source](/literary_products/joes_notes/OPEN_SOURCE_COORDINATION.md) collaboration.
- Enable transparent governance through distributed ledgers.
- Foster new economic models for incentivizing large-scale research.

## Recent Developments in DeSci

Below are highlights of notable activities and advancements in DeSci over the past few years:

1. **Emergence of Specialized DeSci DAOs**  
   - **[VitaDAO](https://www.vitadao.com/)**: Focuses on [longevity research](/literary_products/joes_notes/LONGEVITY_RESEARCH.md) and raises funds via token mechanisms, granting contributors governance rights over project selection.  
   - **Molecule**: Facilitates the tokenization of [intellectual property (IP)](/literary_products/joes_notes/INTELLECTUAL_PROPERTY.md) in biotech research, creating fractional ownership and liquidity for scientific assets.

2. **Accelerated Crowdfunding for Scientific Research**  
   - **NFT-Based Fundraising**: Some DeSci communities experiment with [non-fungible tokens (NFTs)](/literary_products/joes_notes/NFTS.md) representing partial ownership or acknowledgment in research outcomes.  
   - **Global Participation**: Crowdfunding from diverse geographies and demographics bypasses traditional barriers (e.g., academic grants), accelerating the pace of research funding.

3. **Development of Data Infrastructure**  
   - **Federated Learning & Privacy-Preserving Tech**: Projects increasingly use [zero-knowledge proofs](/literary_products/joes_notes/ZERO_KNOWLEDGE_PROOFS.md) and [homomorphic encryption](/literary_products/joes_notes/HOMOMORPHIC_ENCRYPTION.md) to handle sensitive [patient](/literary_products/joes_notes/PATIENT_DATA.md) and genomic data, ensuring compliance with regulations (e.g., [GDPR](/literary_products/joes_notes/GDPR.md), [HIPAA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act)).
   - **Universal Citation & Data Linking**: Multiple initiatives aim to create a decentralized [citation chain](/literary_products/joes_notes/CITATION_CHAIN.md) for peer-reviewed studies, open data sets, and community-driven preprints.

4. **Integration with Traditional Academia**  
   - **Hybrid Models**: Universities and research institutes increasingly explore bridging [DeFi](/literary_products/joes_notes/DEFI.md) and DeSci. Some labs experiment with token-based membership to fund expansions or scholarship programs.  
   - **Institutional Interest**: [Pension funds](/literary_products/joes_notes/PENSION_FUNDS.md) and [sovereign wealth funds](/literary_products/joes_notes/SOVEREIGN_WEALTH_FUNDS.md) show early-stage curiosity in DeSci, though legal and [regulatory environments](/literary_products/joes_notes/REGULATORY_ENVIRONMENTS.md) remain a major consideration.

5. **Open Peer Review Protocols**  
   - **DAO-Governed Review**: DeSci DAOs experiment with token-based reputation systems, staking mechanisms, and decentralized [peer review](/literary_products/joes_notes/PEER_REVIEW_PROTOCOLS.md) to reduce bias and reward quality feedback.  
   - **Transparent Workflow**: Protocols log revisions, citations, and commentary on-chain, creating immutable records of the review process.

## Notable Conferences & Community Events

- **DeSci Berlin 2022**: A gathering focused on bridging the blockchain community and scientific innovators. Presentations highlighted the potential for decentralized genomic research, open data repositories, and new incentive layers for academics.
- **ETHDenver**: Continues to host DeSci panels and hackathons that bring together [Web3](/literary_products/joes_notes/WEB3.md) developers and researchers seeking to build novel collaboration tools.

## Future Outlook

- **Scaling to Billions**: There is significant momentum to incorporate [billions of patient participants](/literary_products/joes_notes/BILLIONS_PARTICIPANTS.md) in global digital therapeutics studies, leveraging blockchain for secure data sharing and compensation.
- **Regulatory Pathways**: As DeSci projects mature, they must navigate evolving securities and health-data regulations. Early positioning can facilitate future partnerships with large-scale institutions.
- **AI Collaboration**: The integration of advanced [AI models](/literary_products/joes_notes/AI_MODELS.md) with open, decentralized scientific databases may enable automated hypothesis generation and more efficient meta-analyses.
