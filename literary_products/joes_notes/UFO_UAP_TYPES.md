## Notes on the Classification System:

1. **Credibility Score**: This is a subjective measure based on the frequency of reports, consistency of descriptions, and quality of evidence. It ranges from 1 (lowest credibility) to 10 (highest credibility).

2. **Frequency of Sightings**: Categorized as Very Low, Low, Moderate, High, or Very High, based on the relative number of reports compared to other types.

3. **Primary Disciplines for Study**: These suggest the most relevant scientific fields for investigating each type of phenomenon, encouraging interdisciplinary collaboration.

4. **Potential Experimental Approaches**: These provide starting points for designing experiments or observational strategies to gather more data on each type.

5. **Linked Resources**: Each type name is hyperlinked to a detailed file, allowing for in-depth exploration of individual phenomena.

This classification system is designed to be dynamic and adaptable. As new data becomes available or new types are identified, the table can be updated to reflect the most current understanding of UAP/UFO phenomena. Researchers are encouraged to use this system as a foundation for developing more sophisticated analysis tools, statistical models, and experimental designs to further our understanding of these aerial phenomena.

The system incorporates various reported UAP and UFO types, including the iconic [flying saucer](/literary_products/encyclopedia/FLYING_SAUCER.md) shape, which gained popularity after the [Kenneth Arnold sighting](/literary_products/encyclopedia/KENNETH_ARNOLD_SIGHTING.md) in 1947. Other notable types include the cigar-shaped UFO, which gained attention with the [ʻOumuamua](/literary_products/encyclopedia/OUMUAMUA.md) object in 2017, and the triangle-shaped UFO, often associated with the [Belgian UFO wave](/literary_products/encyclopedia/BELGIAN_UFO_WAVE.md) of 1989-1990.

By using this structured approach, researchers can better analyze reported sightings, design experiments, and develop hypotheses about the nature and origin of these unidentified phenomena. This classification system aims to provide a comprehensive framework for studying these phenomena, incorporating various scientific disciplines and encouraging rigorous, data-driven investigation.
