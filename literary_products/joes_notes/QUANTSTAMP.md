## Cryptography and Zero-Knowledge Proofs in Quantstamp’s Framework

### 1. **Role of Cryptography**
- **Data Security:** Protects sensitive policyholder data, such as claims and risk profiles.
- **Digital Signatures:** Ensures the authenticity and integrity of transactions.

### 2. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**
- **Applications in Insurance:**
  - Validate policyholder eligibility without revealing private data.
  - Process claims transparently while preserving data privacy.
- **ZKP Circuit Architecture:**
  - **Eligibility Validation Circuits:** Confirm compliance with underwriting criteria.
  - **Claims Validation Circuits:** Verify loss triggers (e.g., fire damage) for payouts.
- **Workflow Example:**
  1. Policyholder submits encrypted data.
  2. ZKP circuits validate the data without exposing raw information.
  3. Smart contracts execute payouts based on validation results.
