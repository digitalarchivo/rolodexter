# Political Realism

## Overview

[Political realism](political_realism.md), also known as [realpolitik](../REALPOLITIK.md) in its practical application, represents a school of thought in [international relations](../INTERNATIONAL_RELATIONS.md) that emphasizes power, national interests, and security as the primary drivers of state behavior. This framework views international politics as inherently competitive and conflict-prone, with war being a natural consequence of the anarchic international system.
