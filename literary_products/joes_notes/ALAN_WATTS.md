**[Alan Watts](/literary_products/joes_notes/ALAN_WATTS.md)** faced several health and personal challenges leading up to his death in [1973](/literary_products/joes_notes/1973.md). While the immediate cause of his passing was a **[heart attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_attack)**, there were underlying factors that contributed to his declining health:

1. **[Alcoholism](/literary_products/joes_notes/ALCOHOLISM.md)**: Alan Watts struggled with alcohol abuse for much of his adult life. His heavy drinking was well-documented and is believed to have had a significant impact on his physical health, potentially contributing to his heart problems.

2. **[Mental Health](/literary_products/joes_notes/MENTAL_HEALTH.md)**: Watts experienced periods of [depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)) and [existential anxiety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_anxiety), which were reflected in his writings and lectures. These mental health challenges may have exacerbated his reliance on alcohol as a coping mechanism.

3. **[Lifestyle Factors](/literary_products/joes_notes/LIFESTYLE_FACTORS.md)**: The lifestyle associated with his career—extensive traveling, irregular routines, and the stresses of [public speaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_speaking) and writing—likely took a toll on his overall well-being.

4. **[Health Awareness](/literary_products/joes_notes/HEALTH_AWARENESS.md)**: During the time Watts lived, there was less awareness and fewer resources available for dealing with [addiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction) and mental health issues. This lack of support may have made it more difficult for him to manage his health effectively.

These factors combined created a complex situation that ultimately affected his longevity. Despite these struggles, Alan Watts left behind a profound legacy through his exploration of [Eastern philosophy](/literary_products/joes_notes/EASTERN_PHILOSOPHY.md), [spirituality](/literary_products/joes_notes/SPIRITUALITY.md), and [psychology](/literary_products/joes_notes/PSYCHOLOGY.md), continuing to inspire and influence many to this day.
