My name is Joe Maristela, and I'm writing to express my interest in joining the [Exabits](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1nbLRwyCevzyEmSCQI8qgCXTrx_TmudVE) team. I believe that humanity's most essential resource—compute power—can be effectively coordinated at the scale necessary to achieve AGI through the innovative financialization model that Exabits envisions.

I aim to contribute to Exabits' growth by supporting their node sale and TGE initiatives in the near-term, while also expanding its enterprise and public sector business ("Exabits Federal") over the long-term.

In 2024, I served as DataHive's Chief Strategy Officer. Initially, I engaged as a consultant (1099), transitioning to a W2 to qualify for DataHive's ESOP. I designed DataHive's core protocol, mid-level smart contract architecture, and a DataHive SDK leveraging our testnet on OP Sepolia. This allowed enterprise customers to "test drive" our vision for the mainnet. Additionally, I:

1. Designed foundational [intelligence and knowledge models](/literary_products/joes_notes/DATAHIVE_AI_ML.md), including the [Legal Intelligence](https://github.com/datahiv3/Legalese-Node-LN1) and Consent Intelligence model, alongside [Vijaylaxmi Lendale](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vijaylaxmilendale/?originalSubdomain=in), a senior AI/ML engineer at Google.
2. Developed [DataHive's public sector business](/literary_products/joes_notes/DATAHIVE_FEDERAL.md) under strategic initiatives.
3. Collaborated with financial advisors to create an overarching valuation framework ensuring economic consistency across narratives presented to investors.

From 2023 to 2024, I consulted for the Linux Foundation hardware division, then joined their partner foundation, the RISC-V Foundation. There, I managed marketing for the core RISC-V ISA and led AI and distributed computing initiatives with key Foundation Members.
