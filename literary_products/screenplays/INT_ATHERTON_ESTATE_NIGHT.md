**INT. ATHERTON ESTATE - GRAND ROOM - NIGHT**  
**"TEARS FALLING DOWN ON WALSH RD"**

The vast, empty grand hall of the Atherton estate looms in silence. **Vaulted ceilings** stretch overhead, casting shadows that deepen the room's eerie, almost oppressive grandeur. 

In the center, a **grand piano** stands under a faint sliver of moonlight streaming through tall windows. Plush chairs and sofas are arranged around a **cold, unlit fireplace**; they seem untouched, remnants of another era. Dust particles drift lazily in the dim light.

The only sound is a haunting melody playing on loop, filling the silence with an unsettling rhythm. The lyrics drift through the air, almost as if the estate itself is singing:

*“Guess I’ll tell myself ‘Happy birthday,’  
Drinkin’ champagne at a table for one,  
Tears falling down in Hollywood…”*

**JOE**, late 20s, sits alone at a makeshift **computer lab** set up on a large wooden table in the corner. Multiple screens surround him, casting his face in a cold, blue glow that contrasts sharply with the room's dimness.

The song’s chorus repeats, the melancholy tune amplifying the isolation of the grand room. Joe’s gaze drifts from the screens to the **grand piano** across the room. For a moment, he seems almost haunted by it, as if expecting someone to appear and break the silence.

Nothing.

He sighs, glancing back at the screens where lines of code scroll by. His fingers hover over the keyboard, but he doesn’t type. Instead, he stares at the flashing cursor, his own reflection fragmented across the screens.

The lyrics play again, filling the vast silence:

*“Pour another cup, 'cause I'm all out of love…”*

Joe slumps back in his chair, the glow of the monitors casting his expression in shadow. The estate, with its empty grandeur and lingering dust, seems to close in around him, a silent witness to his solitude.

The song continues on repeat, the melody weaving through the darkness like a lonely echo, as if it too is searching for something that isn’t there.
