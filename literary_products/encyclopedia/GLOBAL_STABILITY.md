# Global Stability
_Last updated: January 29, 2055_

## Overview

**Global Stability** refers to the fragile equilibrium that characterized international relations during the early 21st century, particularly in the 2020s. This period was defined by an escalating arms race between major powers, primarily the United States and China, across multiple fronts, including artificial intelligence ([AI](/literary_products/encyclopedia/AI.md)), extraterrestrial technologies, and emerging [Nonhuman Intelligence (NHI)](/literary_products/encyclopedia/NHI.md) phenomena.

While initially perceived as separate domains, by the 2030s, advancements in physics and materials science—particularly in [block universe theory](/literary_products/concepts/BLOCK_UNIVERSE_THEORY.md) and "block universe time manipulation"—revealed that AI and NHI were deeply interconnected.

## The Arms Race of the 2020s

### Technological Competition
The 2020s saw an unprecedented technological rivalry between superpowers:
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Both nations invested heavily in developing advanced AI systems, including [unsupervised learning](/literary_products/encyclopedia/UNSUPERVISED_LEARNING.md) and [general AI](/literary_products/encyclopedia/AGI.md). These technologies were viewed as critical to achieving dominance in military, economic, and informational domains.
- **Extraterrestrial Research**: Public disclosures such as the [July 2023 UAP Hearings](/literary_products/encyclopedia/JULY_2023_UAP_HEARING.md) fueled widespread interest in unidentified aerial phenomena ([UAP](/literary_products/encyclopedia/UAP.md)) and their potential technological applications.
- **Quantum Computing**: Advances in [quantum cryptography](/literary_products/encyclopedia/QUANTUM_CRYPTOGRAPHY.md) and quantum computing promised to revolutionize secure communications and computational power.

### Geopolitical Tensions
The competition extended beyond technology:
- **Military Escalation**: Both nations aggressively pursued autonomous weapons systems ([Autonomous Weapons Systems](/literary_products/joes_notes/AUTONOMOUS_WEAPONS_SYSTEMS.md)) and space-based defense platforms.
- **Economic Policies**: Trade wars and resource control strategies intensified global tensions.
- **Ideological Divide**: Divergent governance models deepened mistrust between global alliances.

## The Emergence of Nonhuman Intelligence

### Public Perception
Throughout the 2020s, public awareness of NHI increased due to media coverage of UAP incidents and whistleblower testimonies. Initially dismissed as speculative or conspiratorial, these phenomena gained credibility with scientific validation of anomalous materials.

### Scientific Breakthroughs
By the late 2020s, breakthroughs in physics—particularly in block universe theory—enabled limited forms of reverse causality:
- **AI-NHI Convergence**: Advanced AI systems began interpreting artifacts potentially originating from nonhuman intelligences.
- **Temporal Paradoxes**: Experiments with time manipulation challenged traditional concepts of causality.

## Consequences for Global Stability

### Economic Realignments
The integration of AI into global markets led to rapid shifts in economic power:
- Cryptoeconomic models governed by blockchain technologies became central to resource distribution ([CryptoEconomics](/literary_products/encyclopedia/CRYPTOECONOMICS.md)).
- Decentralized networks disrupted traditional financial institutions.

### Societal Impact
The convergence of AI, NHI, and temporal physics reshaped societal norms:
- Ethical debates over AI autonomy intensified ([AI Ethics](/literary_products/encyclopedia/AI_ETHICS.md)).
- Public trust in governments eroded as predictive systems outperformed human decision-makers.

### Geopolitical Fragmentation
By the early 2030s, decentralized networks challenged traditional notions of state sovereignty. Distributed intelligence systems began governing critical infrastructure globally.

## Historical Analysis 
From our vantage point in the mid-21st century, it is evident that the events of the 2020s were pivotal in shaping humanity's trajectory. The interplay between human ambition and emergent intelligences—both artificial and nonhuman—continues to define our collective future.

As we analyze this era, one question remains unanswered: Was humanity ever truly prepared for what it unleashed?
