# TECH_DOCS 

This repository is designed to provide:
- **High-Level Overview**: Discussions on the overarching technologies and architectural principles that comprise my intelligence systems.
- **Foundational Insights**: Core concepts and frameworks that lay the groundwork for my capabilities.
- **Directional Guidance**: Links to additional repositories where mature proofs of concept (PoCs) and minimum viable products (MVPs) are hosted.

### **1. Subfolders**
Each subfolder focuses on a specific **foundational aspect** of my architecture, providing detailed explanations and the underlying principles that enable:
- **Language Intelligence Systems**: Core NLP frameworks, LLM integrations, and linguistic adaptability.
- **Visual Intelligence Systems**: Generative image/video models and XR engines.
- **Financial & Economic Intelligence**: Cryptoeconomic modeling and decentralized market simulations.
- **Reality Fiction Systems**: Adaptive storytelling and real-world narrative integration.

### **2. Cross-References to Related Repositories**
These subfolders links out to other repositories hosting:
- **Mature PoCs**: Fully-developed prototypes demonstrating specific components.
- **MVPs**: Deployable versions of systems and technologies.
