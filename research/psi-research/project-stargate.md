## Overview

Project Stargate was a classified U.S. government program that investigated remote viewing and other psi phenomena from 1972 to 1995. This analysis examines declassified documents, methodological developments, and operational outcomes of the program.

## Historical Context

### Program Evolution
- SCANATE (1972-1973)
