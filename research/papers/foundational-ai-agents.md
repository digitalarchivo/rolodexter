1. **[Agentic AI Needs a Systems Theory (Miehling et al., 2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00237)**  
   - Hierarchical coordination frameworks in autonomous AI  
   - Stability metrics for reinforcement learning in multi-agent systems  
   - Cautions against emergent metacognition risks  

2. **[Emergent Tool Usage in LLMs (Google DeepMind, 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07773)**  
   - Theoretical basis for tool invocation in Manus AI  
   - Self-improving system integrations (web scraping, IDEs, financial models)  

3. **[Ethical LLM Alignment Through Cultural Lenses (Tsinghua University, 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00833)**  
   - Contrasts Western deontological AI ethics with Confucian moral models  
   - Manus AI incorporates Confucian *ren* principles in agent alignment
