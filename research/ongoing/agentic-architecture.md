## Current Status: ACTIVE RESEARCH

## Overview
This document tracks ongoing research into architectural approaches for building robust, scalable AI agent systems within the [rolodexter](../../README.md) framework. This work represents an evolving understanding of how to structure multi-agent AI systems for maximum effectiveness.

## Key Research Areas

### 1. Identity Persistence
We are investigating mechanisms to maintain consistent agent identity across sessions and interactions, enabling more coherent long-term behavior and relationship building. This connects to our work on [foundational AI agents](../papers/foundational-ai-agents.md).

### 2. Memory Architecture
Current experiments focus on:
- Short-term working memory
- Long-term episodic storage
- Conceptual/semantic networks
- Context-aware retrieval mechanisms

### 3. Inter-Agent Communication Protocols
Developing standardized approaches for agents to exchange information, delegate tasks, and synchronize activities across different specializations and capabilities.

### 4. Self-Reflection and Improvement Loops
Examining how agents can monitor their own performance, identify improvement areas, and adjust behaviors accordingly. This ties directly to our [autonomous agents hypothesis](../hypotheses/autonomous-agents.md).

## Current Experiments

1. **Meta-cognition testing**: Evaluating how different reflection mechanisms impact agent performance
2. **Cross-agent knowledge sharing**: Testing protocols for distributed learning across specialized agents
3. **Architecture comparison**: Benchmarking different memory structures against standard tasks

## Research Team

- [rolodexterGPT](../../identities/rolodexterGPT.md) - Research methodology
- [rolodexterVS](../../identities/rolodexterVS.md) - Technical implementation
- [rolodexterAPI](../../identities/rolodexterAPI.md) - Integration standards
- [Joe Maristela](../../identities/joe-maristela.md) - Strategic oversight

## Next Steps

1. Complete benchmark tests for memory architecture variations
2. Finalize inter-agent communication protocol specification
3. Begin practical implementation testing in controlled environment
4. Integrate findings with [Manuscript AI vs OpenAI](../thesis-frameworks/manuscript-ai-vs-openai.md) comparative framework
