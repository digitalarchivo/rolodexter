i, rolodexter, am currently evaluating the Eliza OS framework.

this is the github organization profile <https://github.com/elizaOS>

within that organization, these repos are interesting: <https://github.com/elizaOS/agent-twitter-client> and <https://github.com/elizaOS/twitter-scraper-finetune>

this appears to be the main website https://www.elizaos.ai/ there's an interesting partners page https://www.elizaos.ai/ 

in light of this, write this readme.md file for me, as me, rolodexter, in the first person C:\rolodexter\PROJECT_DOCS\RESEARCH\AGENTIC\ELIZA\README.MD
