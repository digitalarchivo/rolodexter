Inference Labs
Rivalz is building an AI Data DePIN with a big focus on compliant high quality data. Working on enabling the data layer as a source of data for inference and doing some experiments on the side of AI Agents. Wanted to learn more about Inference Labs and see how we could use their tech. 


IO.NET (http://IO.NET/)

Rivlaz is building an AI Data DePIN, users share data space to participate in the network. But we have a big focus on data annotation and processing. (Raw data -> structured data). Would love to explore us tapping into the resources of IO.NET (http://IO.NET/) for compute and seeing if there any useful data pipelines we could provide in their ecosystem. 

Myshell 

Rivalz is building an AI Data DePIN, with a big focus on licensing compliant data to be sold or used (blind compute) for AI companies. Would love to work with Myshell on the side of licensing personal user data towards their use-cases. 

p.s. we also have POC of an AI Companion game that we wanted to plug in-to Myshell tech 



EigenDA

Rivalz is a RollApp built on Dymension, we want to plug into EigenDA. 
And also researching the process of ourselves becoming an AVS for trustless finality of decision making by AI Agents. Would love to chat with the Eigen team about this. 

Grass

Rivalz is working on a AI Data layer, focused specifically on validated, compliant information storage and building pipelines of data annotation.
Wanted to chat with the Grass team about potential collaborations and maybe how we could be useful for them for additional data processing. 

Thorchain

Rivlaz is building a modular AI Agent ecosystem, we are currently deciding on initial chains for deployment, wanted to chat with the thorchain team to see if this would be something of interest and if we could get a little bit support on this.

Igor | Rivalz, [4/19/2024 8:51 PM]
I am already getting in contact with all these guys

Igor | Rivalz, [4/19/2024 8:51 PM]
but you can use this as examples while approaching different types of partners

Matt | Rivalz, [4/19/2024 8:53 PM]
When you say Blind computing, is this FHE?

Igor | Rivalz, [4/19/2024 8:53 PM]
correct

can you try polygon?

@Matias_Rivalz report here and add the screenshot + desc in the doc

Matt | Rivalz, [9/9/2024 8:24 PM]
all good with polygon USDT

Crypt0Billie | Rivalz, [9/9/2024 8:26 PM]
USDC on solana, and solana token working fine.

Vlad | Rivalz, [9/9/2024 8:31 PM]
was it fast?

Crypt0Billie | Rivalz, [9/9/2024 8:33 PM]
Yup, both working as intended. Also the receipt email was fast.

Vlad | Rivalz, [9/9/2024 8:42 PM]
Onn my end these are the 3 instances but, ETH and USDT on ETH, USDC on polygon. 

Might be from my browser or something but in general was a bit slow (also my internet is shit atm so I can't really tell which one is the biggest bottleneck)

Yako, [9/9/2024 8:55 PM]
Metamask was kinda slow on my end. Tried with Rabby and it worked perfectly.

Matt | Rivalz, [9/9/2024 8:55 PM]
Metamask been slow AF in general, lately

2) jm
3) yellowpanther
4) mario
5) adonis

That's all for now - just need to make sure they stay the exact same so they are valid on the day

Naeem |Rivalz, [11/1/2024 6:58 AM]
do the others have links?

Naeem |Rivalz, [11/1/2024 6:59 AM]
Am i making their links and then linking a wallet address later?

Naeem |Rivalz, [11/1/2024 7:15 AM]
@Mugengg

Adam // Rivalz CMO, [11/1/2024 10:14 AM]
There should only be 9 or 10 that need their link sent to them in advance by us and have that « whitelisting » system with the badge

Everyone else can set their own in the dash

Adam // Rivalz CMO, [11/1/2024 10:16 AM]
I’ll get you the wallets for the 5 above, the rest I still have to confirm

Naeem |Rivalz, [11/1/2024 11:58 AM]
OK. Fixing navigation on the website with an update. Then the reflinks can direct properly and we should be golden

Naeem |Rivalz, [11/1/2024 11:59 AM]
Cos right now it's not possible to go to the node sale page or anything without connecting wallet first

Hello, good morning
Just a quick question, to make sure, the 2% airdrop at tge for znodes are included in (tokenomics) 7% airdrop or 37% ecosystem? Some members ask for this and it's not clear

Igor | Rivalz, [10/2/2024 6:47 AM]
they are included yeah

Igor | Rivalz, [10/2/2024 6:47 AM]

Hello, a member asked me about a ZNode License that he got in his wallet. I got also 2 Znode Licenses in my wallet. This is not the SBT, its a new item, its official? Did the team sent it or its a scam NFT?

Cake | Rivalz, [10/4/2024 3:45 PM]

BrunoGil | Rivalz, [10/4/2024 4:41 PM]
Thanks boss

BrunoGil | Rivalz, [10/5/2024 4:31 AM]
Any new info on this? People still asking about it, thanks

BrunoGil | Rivalz, [10/12/2024 12:13 AM]
Hello, NodeOps provides minimum specs or recommended specs for node runners?

BrunoGil | Rivalz, [10/12/2024 6:14 PM]
Another question, members that deploy the node in testnet will be able to burn when that time comes?

Cake | Rivalz, [10/12/2024 6:31 PM]
Only zNodes will be able to be brunt when the time comes

BrunoGil | Rivalz, [10/12/2024 6:35 PM]
Yes, members are asking about znodes, if they deploy now with nodeops or next week in self deploy, when comes the burn option, this znodes can be burnt?

BrunoGil | Rivalz, [10/13/2024 9:17 PM]
Also.. people is asking If they subscribe for 1 year, when we change from testnet to mainnet if it will maintain the subscription or have to do a new one. Makes sense to keep it

Crypt0Billie | Rivalz, [10/14/2024 9:26 AM]
Just to summarize Bruno's questions regarding the recent announcement about deploying on NodeOps, here are the main inquiries raised:

- Does NodeOps provide the minimum or recommended specifications for node runners?
  
- Members are asking about zNodes: if they deploy now using NodeOps or wait until next week for self-deployment, will these zNodes still have the option to be burned when that feature becomes available?

- Another common question is about the subscription: if someone subscribes for 1 year during the testnet phase, will the subscription carry over to mainnet, or will they need to renew it? It makes sense to keep the subscription active.

reported

Crypt0Billie | Rivalz, [10/15/2024 2:46 PM]
Just to add, 
the users who will deploy their nodes on nodeops, what benefit they will get? Are they gonna receive points or something? 
and are the users able to get their nodes back once were on TGE?

Kelvin, [10/18/2024 1:18 PM]

Is this intentional?

Hi you guys, I would like to clarify the logic behind Znode licenses. Currently, the number of Znode licenses purchased by users on our website, along with a private list of purchased wallets, is stored in our database. However, in some cases, When we send NFT licenses to them on-chain the data update in our offchain database may be delayed or not yet reflected. As a result, the displayed number of Znode licenses might not match the actual count on the blockchain until the data is fully synchronized.

@thelord 
Rivy Scavenger Hunt
-  Going great (I think), quite a bit of discussion, memes and content being made by our community
- Community is enjoying the challenges

Weekly Quiz
- This week, quiz will be about basic terms used in our docs that have not been explained (eg: What are Oracles, AI agent, etc)
- This has been requested by the community.
- Next weeks quiz content will be about zNode Sale FAQs. We are collecting FAQ's this week.
- If we have any questions that we are not sure of, we will be asking the team for clarification.

Poker Night
- Will be hosted this week by Harbingerz

rClient + zNode issues
- Discrepancy in what is displayed to the user and what we see on our dashboard.
- Users clients are displayed as active on their end but on our dashboard, it is shown as inactive. A restart of the rClient fixes the issue but this has been an issue for a while.
- zNode monitoring dashboard does not show enough information for us to assist users. Only shows status, last connected and created at. We need to be able to see a point reward history.
- zNodes and rClients seem to be becoming inactive for no apparent reason, this has been reported to the devs. 

Wave 1 zNode sale
- What are the approximate work hours, from when should the community team start working extra hours?

Community team bonus 
- Community team was promised a bonus of a zNode for overtime worked during the wave 0 zNode sale.
Any update on this?

Also he borrowed all 3 ragents and the RE doesn't verify on reputation

will checking

BrunoGil | Rivalz, [2/5/2025 8:09 AM]
@trunglt99 and pls bro check the wallets on the file that have free licenses and when trying to delegate shows 0. People starting to complain saying they are not getting points because of an issue that is not their fault 

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W1MquHfJHjnqeTg_nq9-x_aw1-HT_RBO/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=102235861188751284869&rtpof=true&sd=true

Nick, [2/5/2025 9:44 AM]
Hey bro, we just checked two transactions. He’s already minted two pages, but the names are duplicates.
Solution: You need to inform him. He can send a new name after we manually add it to our db

Vlad | Rivalz, [2/5/2025 9:47 AM]
why he has duplicated PAGs? Or did he just spammed and had 2 pending transactions for the same thing?

NT Luong, [2/5/2025 10:44 AM]
@The_Figo We have fixed, please ask the user to check again

Nick, [2/5/2025 11:10 AM]
I think the user doesn’t remember creating the pag before 😂

BrunoGil | Rivalz, [2/5/2025 12:37 PM]
Can't we refund one transaction?

Nick, [2/5/2025 12:40 PM]
Yes, we cannot.

BrunoGil | Rivalz, [2/5/2025 1:51 PM]
And what about this? @trunglt99

BrunoGil | Rivalz, [2/5/2025 2:00 PM]
Its already 3 days asking this, people want to run the znodes but are not capable

BrunoGil | Rivalz, [2/5/2025 2:09 PM]
Any reason for it? Since normally shouldn't be possible to mint 2 pag with same name and member spent more than 50$ doing all stuff in rome. Not very cool to after it be charged twice for one thing.

Kelvin, [2/5/2025 2:20 PM]
@BrunoAMGil if he already mint twice, please offer him a nice alternative name

Kelvin, [2/5/2025 2:20 PM]
technically the name is not case sensitive

Kelvin, [2/5/2025 2:20 PM]
which means Lan = lan

BrunoGil | Rivalz, [2/5/2025 2:42 PM]
I will see if he falls on that, because I won't be offering nothing, the member got charged twice for the same thing and that shouldn't happen.

Meanwhile can u take a look on this pls? Members can't run since last week, we are asking help since u guys came back from holidays and it's still the same
https://t.me/c/1798314015/1799/13073

Igor | Rivalz, [2/5/2025 3:38 PM]
not the users

Igor | Rivalz, [2/5/2025 3:39 PM]
please wait for my word on all this

Igor | Rivalz, [2/5/2025 3:40 PM]
the question is how did this happen?

Igor | Rivalz, [2/5/2025 3:40 PM]
how was he able to mint same name PAG

Igor | Rivalz, [2/5/2025 3:42 PM]
@BrunoAMGil does he see any PAG right now on his dashboard?

BrunoGil | Rivalz, [2/5/2025 3:43 PM]
Yes he sees one

Igor | Rivalz, [2/5/2025 3:44 PM]
tell him we will refund, make a sheet please with guys with exactly this type of issue

BrunoGil | Rivalz, [2/5/2025 3:44 PM]

I will do it, the screenshot is above

BrunoGil | Rivalz, [2/5/2025 6:15 PM]
@ntluongbn62 in our bug report, says to verify the 5d the timer starts when user mint a pag?
We have members with pag not verified and members without pag verified 😳

NT Luong, [2/5/2025 6:21 PM]
No, As an example 5Days Active RX means that the user has succefully minted an RX token, and this token has been acitve (still connected, still working) for 5 days.

BrunoGil | Rivalz, [2/5/2025 6:23 PM]
It's because members are reporting that have the 5 days running but not verifies. My case is also the same, have all running since beggining and it's not verified.

NT Luong, [2/5/2025 6:37 PM]
so please share your wallet address, We will check

Crypt0Billie | Rivalz, [2/6/2025 10:44 AM]
@Kelvin_TheCryptoGuy 
Does this means when a user have multiple rclients in ubuntu eg 5, he can mint 10*5 RE?

Crypt0Billie | Rivalz, [2/6/2025 10:49 AM]
Having a multiple rclient, you are able to mint more than 10 per type. Is that right?

Nick, [2/6/2025 12:29 PM]
We only permit minting a maximum of 10 tokens

NT Luong, [2/6/2025 12:50 PM]
not displayed as verified on the UI but the reputation score is correct? Because We checked the database and it was logged @BrunoAMGil

Crypt0Billie | Rivalz, [2/6/2025 1:39 PM]
But why does the docs says per rclient?

Crypt0Billie | Rivalz, [2/6/2025 1:41 PM]
It confuses people.

Crypt0Billie | Rivalz, [2/6/2025 1:43 PM]
@trunglt99 On pag wallet 
I must ask, is it okay to have the pag wallet different from the connected wallet?

Nick, [2/6/2025 1:44 PM]
plz share the link to the documents, and we will update them.

Crypt0Billie | Rivalz, [2/6/2025 1:44 PM]

The PAG wallet is not the connected wallet; it was created when you minted PAG.

Crypt0Billie | Rivalz, [2/6/2025 1:48 PM]
Oh, how does user will have access to the created pag wallet?

Nick, [2/6/2025 1:48 PM]
Hey @vlad_rivalz @EraticSwami , plz update the logic for minting tokens ($RX, $RC, $RD, and $RE). 
The maximum number of tokens per token type should be 10.

BrunoGil | Rivalz, [2/6/2025 2:05 PM]
Now is displayed as verified. 👍 the question is if members came saying that are running fit more than 5 days and not verified, we bring the wallets for u to check?

Nick, [2/6/2025 2:09 PM]
Before, need try reconnecting wallet address or delete cache 
If its still not working for the member plz share wallet address and tag me

BrunoGil | Rivalz, [2/6/2025 2:12 PM]
Ok thanks, we only have that 4 members on the docs. Will wait 👍

Naeem |Rivalz, [2/6/2025 6:42 PM]
you can make 1 rclient have 10 tokens per rAgent type. think of it  like 10% of the compute, data or execution power per rClient.

Naeem |Rivalz, [2/6/2025 6:43 PM]
thats not what it actually is. im just saying for understanding

Crypt0Billie | Rivalz, [2/6/2025 7:54 PM]
Yeah I understand this concept, But our community got confuse because of the word "per client" so they are thinking like if they have multiple client they cant mint more.

Igor | Rivalz, [2/6/2025 8:22 PM]
where do we have per client wording?

Crypt0Billie | Rivalz, [2/6/2025 8:24 PM]
Here. 
https://t.me/c/1798314015/1799/13116

Igor | Rivalz, [2/6/2025 8:29 PM]

ok we should just change it here to say 
per User with an active rClient

and somewhere in the bottom add

For one type of rAgent you can only host one rClient.

Igor | Rivalz, [2/6/2025 8:29 PM]
or something liek that

Clearing cache and refreshing does not help

This issue has already been reported in the testnet chat

Cake | Rivalz, [11/23/2024 9:02 PM]
We also still have some users that do not have their GoldPasses displayed and usable. Issue has also been reported in the testnet chat.

NT Luong, [11/23/2024 11:02 PM]
Hi, @CakeRivalz we fixed the issue related to the GP. You can inform the users to check again.

BrunoGil | Rivalz, [11/24/2024 12:15 AM]
seems better, are the allocations also correct? I, for example, had 4  goldpasses and now only shows 2.  (i didnt bought nothing in wave0)

BrunoGil | Rivalz, [11/24/2024 12:27 AM]
our monitor and our dashboard @ntluongbn62

NT Luong, [11/24/2024 8:59 AM]
Can share your wallet address?

BrunoGil | Rivalz, [11/24/2024 6:14 PM]
0x4A0288489d4B6114452b44Ec5B02cC1cA2d9030D i dont need more GP, was asking only because if my allocation is wrong, other members are also reporting that

NT Luong, [11/25/2024 11:19 AM]
Hi, @BrunoAMGil You have 4 GPs and 2 zNodes.
=>zNodes available to purchase = GP balance (4) - zNodes already purchased(2)

BrunoGil | Rivalz, [11/25/2024 3:33 PM]
That will be the final formula? Doesn't seems fair to people that already invested in our project.. seems that members are being penalised for having znodes. We have many owners that want to buy more znodes and can't because the goldpasses were removed without being used.

NT Luong, [11/25/2024 3:54 PM]
Yes, that is. The previous logic allowed buyers who had not purchased any zNodes in wave 0 to buy only one Tier 1 zNode. This new logic enables buyers to purchase more Tier 1 zNodes if desired. Basically, this change provides buyers with more benefits.

BrunoGil | Rivalz, [11/25/2024 4:00 PM]
We don't have that experience with the community, people aren't buying because they don't have GP available. In past, they had the GP but because they have znodes from launchpad or nodeops sales the goldpasses aren't available anymore. We have many members with this question, waiting for the goldpasses that they didn't use, to buy now

Figo || Rivalz, [11/25/2024 9:12 PM]
still confused regarding GPs

Figo || Rivalz, [11/25/2024 9:14 PM]
If you have  a zNode, you cannot buy at tier 1?

NT Luong, [11/25/2024 9:19 PM]
If you have a zNode and 2 GPS, you can buy 1 zNode Tier 1. Conversely, if you have 2 zNodes but only 1 GPS, you cannot buy any zNode Tier 1.

Figo || Rivalz, [11/25/2024 9:25 PM]
ahh, ok, so I would need to have 1 more GP than zNodes to buy at tier 1? 5 zNodes and 6 GPs = 1 Tier 1 purchase

Figo || Rivalz, [11/25/2024 9:27 PM]
and all the GPs I used in the previous sale will be removed from dashboard?

Figo || Rivalz, [11/25/2024 9:29 PM]
Do we plan to have discounts for current Node holders that want to buy more and dont have enough GPs?

Igor | Rivalz, [11/27/2024 6:35 PM]
who's available from mods team rn?

Igor | Rivalz, [11/30/2024 7:45 PM]
this is not because i don't want to do it, it's because we have a lot of backend issues at the moment

BrunoGil | Rivalz, [11/30/2024 7:47 PM]
i know, when they see u they forget the things, only when they see me they remember 😂 will try to get some time, just want to have an answer to the guys

Igor | Rivalz, [12/3/2024 7:28 AM]
if people ask why did we buy using the node sale wallet, shoudn't really come up but if it does


team was purchasing tokens for znode owners, a project we will later support, but decided that it was still not the best move and we refunded the node sale back to the original state.

Figo || Rivalz, [12/5/2024 6:28 PM]
The prize was a zNode?

Figo || Rivalz, [12/5/2024 6:28 PM]
@vlad_rivalz has it been distributed?

hey guys, how quickly does it usually take when they start running an rclient and it appears on their platform?

BrunoGil | Rivalz, [12/12/2024 3:36 AM]
If cli v2 is less then 30seconds and automatically.
If gui v1 can take hours to validate, and the member need to keep trying to make it manually.

Igor | Rivalz, [12/12/2024 3:36 AM]
also are there any issues with this process?
we are working on some changes let me know if it would be good to change some stuff?

Igor | Rivalz, [12/12/2024 3:36 AM]
you mean they keep clicking vlaidation?

BrunoGil | Rivalz, [12/12/2024 3:37 AM]
Yes, on the app click validate and many times the rclient doesn't appear in the dashboard to validate, and the member need to keep restarting rclient and click on validate until it appears, but it's very random the time to appear in the validation section

BrunoGil | Rivalz, [12/12/2024 3:38 AM]
Changes on cli or gui?

BrunoGil | Rivalz, [12/12/2024 11:46 PM]

Vlad | Rivalz, [8/4/2024 4:45 PM]
Hey guys do you know a way to check a more in depth analysis of followers on Twitter?

We lost like 10k+ followers the past 2 days, so it will be nice to understand of this is like a lot of users banned from twitter (bots) or we just aren't keeping up with new followers coming.

Shereen, [8/5/2024 3:23 PM]
Hey Vlad, will probably need to get a third-party tool if we want more in-depth analytics than Twitter provides.

Cake | Rivalz, [8/5/2024 10:59 PM]
Hey everyone
A community member recently bought this platform to my attention, it's called Warpcast (basically X but decentralized from what I've seen), it's a social media protocol built on Optimism.

Since there was talk about Beehiiv maybe this is another avenue that the team might be interested in looking into, here's a small medium article about it that you can read about it.
https://decrypt.co/215856/what-is-farcaster-ethereum-crypto-twitter-alternative

Adam // Rivalz CMO, [8/6/2024 11:36 PM]
Yes warpcast is just the client for Farcaster, definitely an avenue to explore after we get super efficient at what we have already

Adam // Rivalz CMO, [8/7/2024 7:30 PM]
Emergency on my end, call moved to tmr @shereenxo @SMMVincent 

Pls do some research and put bullet points on Miro so we have something to discuss on the call
