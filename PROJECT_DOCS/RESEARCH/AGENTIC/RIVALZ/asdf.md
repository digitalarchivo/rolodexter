Token Utility and Nodes:

The $RIZ token serves various functions within the Rivalz ecosystem, providing essential utility and incentives for network participants. One of its primary roles is to incentivize the supply of network data and infrastructure, ensuring the seamless operation and growth of the ecosystem. Additionally, $RIZ tokens are used to reward processing tasks performed by games and AI applications running on the platform.

Users holding and staking $RIZ tokens gain access to several benefits, including early access to new AI games and products, a higher yield on their investments, opportunities for node upgrades, and participation in governance decisions shaping the ecosystem's future.

The network operates through two main types of nodes: rNodes and zNodes. rNodes receive a low emission of $xRIZ tokens, with emissions based on factors such as uptime, storage capacity, and computational resources. Staking $RIZ tokens can increase emission rates for rNodes, providing additional incentives for token holders to contribute to the network.

In contrast, zNodes play a crucial role in validating data flows within the ecosystem. They receive a higher emission of $xRIZ tokens, but require a special key for operation. Like rNodes, emissions for zNodes are based on uptime, ensuring the reliability and security of the network's data validation process.
