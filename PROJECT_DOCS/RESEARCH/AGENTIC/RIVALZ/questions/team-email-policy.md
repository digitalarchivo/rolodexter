# Questions: Team Email Policy

## Context
Development team members are currently using Gmail addresses for work purposes. This raises questions about chain of custody and standardization of communication channels.

## Key Questions
1. Email Domain Standards
   - Should all developers use corporate email domains?
   - Which domain should be standard (truestack.ai vs rivalz.ai)?
   - What are the implications for contractors vs full-time team members?

2. Chain of Custody
   - How does email domain affect chain of custody?
   - What are the security implications?
   - Are there legal/compliance considerations?

3. Migration Considerations
   - What systems require email updates?
   - How would migration affect existing access/permissions?
   - What timeline would be appropriate?

## Current Status
- Some developers using Gmail addresses
- Others using corporate domains
- No immediate urgency for change
- Under consideration for future standardization

## Impact Areas
- GitHub access
- ClickUp tasks
- Google Docs sharing
- Meeting invitations
- Client communications

## Team Feedback
- Dat Ho: Noted some developers don't have rivalz accounts
- Team accepting of either truestack.ai or rivalz.ai
- No immediate concerns raised

## Next Steps
