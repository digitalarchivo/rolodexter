# High-Level GLIK Architecture

## Overview
GLIK's architecture is designed as a multi-layered system built on a foundation of microservices and event-driven communication. The system transitions from traditional cloud infrastructure (AWS/Azure) to Rivalz's decentralized infrastructure (DePIN).

## Core Components

### 1. Multi-Agent Framework Layer
- Python-based orchestration engine
- Agent lifecycle management
- Event bus system
- Workflow engine
- Data enrichment services

### 2. Infrastructure Layer
#### Phase 1: Cloud Native
- AWS/Azure Services
- Container orchestration
- Managed databases
- Authentication services

#### Phase 2: Hybrid
- Initial DePIN integration
- Hybrid compute model
- Bridge services
- Multi-region deployment

#### Phase 3: DePIN Native
- Decentralized compute
- Blockchain-based identity
- P2P agent communication
- Distributed storage

### 3. Application Layer
- AI Agent Studio
- Process Center
- Communications Hub
- Avatar System
- Developer Tools

### 4. Integration Layer
- External API gateway
- Plugin system
- SaaS connectors
- Custom integrations
