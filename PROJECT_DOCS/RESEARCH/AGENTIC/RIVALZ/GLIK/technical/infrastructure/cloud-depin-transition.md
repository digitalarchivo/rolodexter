# Infrastructure Transition Strategy: Cloud to DePIN

## Overview
This document outlines the technical investigation and transition strategy for migrating GLIK from traditional cloud infrastructure (AWS/Azure) to Rivalz's decentralized infrastructure (DePIN).

## Investigation Areas

### 1. Current Cloud Dependencies
- AWS Services
  - Lambda: Agent execution
  - ECS: Container orchestration
  - DynamoDB: State management
  - Cognito: Authentication
  
- Azure Services
  - OpenAI: Model integration
  - Container Apps: Service hosting
  - Cosmos DB: Data storage
  - Key Vault: Secret management

### 2. DePIN Equivalent Services

#### Compute Layer
- Agent Execution
  - P2P compute network
  - Distributed task scheduler
  - Resource allocation protocol
  
#### Storage Layer
- State Management
  - Distributed state store
  - IPFS integration
  - Blockchain state anchoring
  
#### Identity & Auth
- Authentication
  - Blockchain-based identity
  - Multi-sig authorization
  - Zero-knowledge proofs

## Technical Spikes

### Spike 1: P2P Agent Execution
Duration: 2 weeks
```python
# Proof of concept architecture
class DePINAgentExecutor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.p2p_network = P2PNetwork()
        self.resource_manager = ResourceManager()
        
    async def execute_agent(self, agent_id: str, task: Dict):
        # Test distributed execution
        resources = await self.resource_manager.allocate()
        return await self.p2p_network.dispatch(agent_id, task, resources)
```

### Spike 2: Distributed State Management
Duration: 2 weeks
- Test IPFS for agent state storage
- Evaluate consensus mechanisms
- Measure latency impact
- Assess data consistency

### Spike 3: Identity System
Duration: 1 week
- Test blockchain identity integration
- Evaluate authorization flows
- Measure transaction costs
- Assess user experience

## Transition Phases
