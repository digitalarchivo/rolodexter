# Igor's Strategic Direction for Rivalz Products

Igor, CEO of Rivalz, provided several insights and directions regarding Glik, the core product under development, and Vord, the underlying platform. Here are the key takeaways:

1. **System Architecture and Focus**:
   - Igor emphasized that Glik's architecture should not be narrowly defined as "Knowledge Retrieval" but instead as a system for orchestration with multi-agent processes and workflows. He clarified that while knowledge retrieval is part of its functionality, the system's broader purpose is system orchestration.
   - He highlighted the importance of managing the system primarily through API calls rather than relying on a chat interface, which should not be a core feature.

2. **Documentation and Clarity**:
   - Igor stressed the need for clear definitions within the documentation. This includes defining what constitutes a system, its start and end points, agents, workflows, and events. He also sought clarity on how developers can control events and integrate their agents into the system.
   - He requested updates to ensure that the documentation reflects these broader definitions and functionalities, making it more professional and comprehensive.

3. **Agent Functionality**:
   - In discussions about agent capabilities, Igor pointed out that agents should be able to work with external APIs to cover various use cases. This aligns with the goal of enabling Glik to handle complex workflows and integrate seamlessly with external systems.
   - He encouraged research into competitors' functionalities to identify gaps and opportunities for improvement.

4. **Strategic Integration**:
   - Igor suggested leveraging tools like Thirdweb for certain functionalities, such as integrating Solana wallets into Glik. This reflects his focus on using established solutions to accelerate development and enhance platform capabilities.

5. **Collaborative Development**:
   - Igor frequently emphasized collaboration among team members, urging them to align on priorities and ensure that all elements of the platform are well-documented, functional, and ready for client use.

In summary, Igor's comments reflect a strategic focus on positioning Glik as a robust AI workflow platform capable of handling multi-agent processes through API-driven orchestration, built on top of the Vord platform. He also prioritized clear documentation to support developers and clients in utilizing the system effectively.
