Igor made several comments about Dify in relation to VORD's development, primarily focusing on leveraging its documentation and functionalities as a reference point. Here are the main points:

1. **Documentation as a Benchmark**:
   - Igor emphasized using Dify's documentation as a guide to improve VORD's own technical documentation. He instructed the team to adopt relevant sections from Dify's materials while tailoring them to VORD's needs. This included ensuring clarity in defining system architecture, workflows, and agent integrations.

2. **Addressing Shortcomings**:
   - Igor acknowledged that Dify's documentation had some shortcomings but suggested it was still a useful resource. He directed the team to enhance VORD's documentation by addressing these gaps and making it more professional and comprehensive.

3. **System Architecture Alignment**:
   - He reinforced that VORD's architecture should focus on system orchestration with multi-agent processes and workflows, rather than being narrowly defined as a knowledge retrieval system. This broader scope aligns with the functionalities seen in platforms like Dify.

4. **Focus on API-Driven Management**:
   - Igor reiterated that VORD should be managed primarily through API calls rather than relying on a chat interface, which should remain secondary. This aligns with the need for a robust backend system similar to what is seen in platforms like Dify.

In summary, Igor viewed Dify as a valuable reference for structuring VORD’s documentation and functionalities but emphasized adapting and improving upon it to suit VORD’s broader goals of orchestration and multi-agent workflows.
