# Technical Decision: RNet-AI Repositories Migration Strategy

## Context
Several repositories under the RNet-AI organization contain work that is relevant to Rivalz:
- rnet-stack
- sidelined
- glik-stack
- api

These repositories need to be evaluated and potentially migrated to the Rivalz organization.

## Decision Drivers
- Need to maintain project history and continuity
- Ensure smooth transition of active development
- Prevent disruption to any existing integrations
- Preserve intellectual property and sensitive information

## Considered Options
1. Direct repository transfer
2. Gradual migration with parallel development
3. Clean-slate approach with new repositories

## Migration Approach
### Phase 1: Analysis
- Audit each repository's contents and dependencies
- Document active integrations and service connections
- Identify security-sensitive components

### Phase 2: Planning
- Create repository-specific migration plans
- Set up corresponding repositories in Rivalz organization
- Plan for handling sensitive data and credentials

### Phase 3: Execution
- Migrate repositories one at a time
- Update documentation and references
- Validate functionality post-migration

## Consequences
### Positive
- Consolidated project management
- Improved visibility within Rivalz organization
- Streamlined access control

### Negative
- Temporary development slowdown during migration
- Potential for integration disruptions
- Need to update external references
