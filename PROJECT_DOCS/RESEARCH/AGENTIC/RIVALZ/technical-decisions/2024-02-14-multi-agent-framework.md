# Technical Decision Record: Multi-Agent Framework Development

## Context
The multi-agent framework (ClickUp task 8697x273t) is being developed as a foundational component, distinct from but related to both VORD and Glik platforms. This needs to be clearly documented and tracked.

## Decision Overview
- ID: 2024-02-14-01
- Date: 2024-02-14
- Status: In Development
- Decision Maker: Daniel Ho (CTO)
- Impact: High

## Current State
- Framework development in progress
- Led by Daniel Ho
- Tracked in ClickUp (8697x273t)
- Integration points with VORD and Glik pending documentation

## Technical Details

### Architecture Components
1. Framework Core
   - Agent communication protocols
   - Task orchestration system
   - Resource management
   - State handling

2. Integration Points
   - VORD platform connectivity
   - Glik system integration
   - External agent support
   - Cross-platform communication

3. Development Focus
   - Agent interaction patterns
   - Workflow orchestration
   - Resource coordination
   - System scalability

## Implementation Strategy
1. Phase 1: Core Framework
   - Basic agent communication
   - Resource management system
   - State coordination
   - Basic workflows

2. Phase 2: Integration Layer
   - VORD platform integration
   - Glik system connectivity
   - External agent support
   - Cross-platform protocols

3. Phase 3: Advanced Features
   - Complex workflow management
   - Advanced orchestration
   - Performance optimization
   - Scale testing

## Risk Assessment
### Technical Risks
- Integration complexity
- Performance bottlenecks
- Scalability challenges
- Cross-platform compatibility

### Mitigation Strategies
- Phased implementation
- Regular architecture reviews
- Performance testing
- Integration validation

## Next Steps
1. Documentation
   - Complete architecture documentation
   - Define integration specifications
   - Create implementation guides
   - Establish testing protocols

2. Development
   - Core framework implementation
   - Integration layer development
   - Testing and validation
   - Performance optimization

3. Integration Planning
   - VORD platform integration
   - Glik system connectivity
   - External system support
   - Cross-platform testing

## Success Criteria
- Framework core functionality
- Successful integration tests
- Performance benchmarks met
- Documentation completeness
