# Technical Decision Record: Dify Embedding Security Implementation

## Context
Daniel Ho has identified security concerns regarding iframe embedding of our application, particularly with Dify integration. The current implementation needs enhanced security measures to prevent unauthorized embedding and ensure proper third-party service integration.

## Decision
We will implement:
1. Origin website whitelisting system for iframe embedding
2. Enhanced security measures for Dify embedding
3. Structured approach for third-party service connections

## Technical Details

### Iframe Security Implementation
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Configure frame-ancestors directive for allowed domains
- Create configurable whitelist system for approved origins

### Dify Embedding Requirements
- Monitor and integrate latest Dify embedding features
- Implement secure communication channels between Dify and our application
- Ensure proper authentication flow

### Third-Party Integration Architecture
- Implement secure connection handlers for each service:
  - Google services
  - Dynamic xyz
  - Other required integrations
- Create standardized security verification process

## Consequences

### Positive
- Enhanced security for embedded applications
- Controlled access to application features
- Standardized third-party integration process

### Negative
- Additional implementation time required
- Need for ongoing maintenance of whitelist
- Potential impact on integration testing timeline

## Implementation Plan
1. Phase 1 - Immediate Solution (P0)
   - Enable embedding without Google signin
   - Document domain requirements for clients
   - Implement basic domain validation
   - Deploy quick solution for priority clients

2. Phase 2 - Full Security Implementation
   - Research and document latest Dify embedding capabilities
   - Design and implement whitelisting system
   - Create integration handlers for third-party services
   - Implement testing framework
   - Document security measures and maintenance procedures

## Status
Phase 1 Implementation In Progress

## Updates
### 2024-02-14
- Priority raised due to client impact
- Approved temporary solution without Google signin
- Implementation to be discussed with team
