# Glik Development Roadmap - AI Workspace Suite

## Vision Statement
Glik aims to become the comprehensive AI workspace suite for the future of work - analogous to what Office365 is for traditional productivity tools. Instead of Word, Excel, and Outlook, Glik will provide an integrated ecosystem of AI solutions, agent studios, autonomous bots, and customizable AI avatars that form the backbone of next-generation workplace productivity.

## Core Vision & Purpose
Glik is being developed as a Multi-Agent blockbuilder app that enables users to create, customize, and orchestrate their own AI Agents. The platform caters to both no-code users and advanced developers, allowing them to build agents and agent swarms leveraging Rivalz infrastructure.

## Status
- Date: 2024-02-15
- Status: DRAFT
- Decision Makers: Igor (CEO, Principal Decision Maker)
- Technical Lead: Dat (Multi-Agent Systems Architecture)

## Context and Requirements
Glik is positioned as a comprehensive AI workspace platform that will revolutionize how organizations interact with AI technology. Under Igor's strategic direction and Dat's technical leadership, the platform's initial focus will be on developing a robust Python-based multi-agent framework as the foundation for the broader AI workspace suite. Built initially on AWS and Azure infrastructure, with a planned transition to Rivalz's decentralized infrastructure (DePIN), the platform combines powerful multi-agent orchestration with user-friendly AI tools that parallel traditional office suite applications for the AI era.
