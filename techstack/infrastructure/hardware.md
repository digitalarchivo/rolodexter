## Computing Environments

### Workbench Lab (Fixed Location)
High-performance development environment for intensive tasks:
- Custom-built workstations with multiple GPUs
- Advanced cooling systems
- Multiple display setups
- Dedicated network infrastructure

The Workbench Lab serves as our primary development hub, featuring carefully engineered workspaces optimized for extended development sessions. Each station is equipped with precision-calibrated displays and ergonomic setups that enable our team to work efficiently on complex tasks for extended periods.

### Mobile Lab
Portable high-performance computing setup:

The Mobile Lab represents our solution for maintaining development capabilities while traveling. At its core is a set of specialized Pelican cases, custom-modified with shock absorption and climate control systems. These cases are designed to safely transport our high-performance equipment through various environments while meeting airline regulations for carry-on and checked baggage.

#### High-Performance Laptops
- 3-5 Latest generation laptops
- Specialized GPUs and NPUs
- High RAM configurations
- NVMe storage arrays
- Custom cooling solutions

For travel configurations, Joe maintains a minimum viable set of equipment that includes two primary development laptops and one backup unit. Each laptop is configured with redundant storage and the ability to handle any critical development task independently. This ensures continuity of work even if one system experiences issues.
