## Prescription Cognitive Enhancers

### Methylphenidate
- **Mechanism**: Dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition
- **Effects**: Improves focus and working memory
- **Research Data**: 
  - Moderate effect sizes (Cohen's *d* = 0.6–0.8) on DSST tasks
  - Low doses (2–5 mg/kg) enhance prefrontal cortex activity
  - Gene expression changes in striatal and cortical regions
- **Considerations**: 
  - Dose-dependent effects on spatial working memory
  - Risk of overstimulation at higher doses
  - Potential synergistic effects with SSRIs

### Bupropion
- **Mechanism**: Norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibition (NDRI)
- **Effects**: Enhances attention and executive function
- **Research Data**:
  - 25–26% dopamine transporter occupancy at therapeutic doses
  - Improved functional connectivity between dmPFC and posterior cingulate
  - 2.79-point increase in DSST scores over placebo
- **Considerations**:
  - Preserves salience network activity
  - Most effective in baseline dopaminergic deficits
  - Structural similarities to cathinone require careful monitoring

### Vortioxetine
- **Mechanism**: 5-HT3 antagonism with 5-HT1A agonism
- **Effects**: Enhances synaptic plasticity and memory
- **Research Data**:
  - 2.91-point MMSE improvement in 12-month AD trials
  - 1.14-point gains in RAVLT acquisition
  - 0.47-point improvements in delayed recall
- **Considerations**:
  - Preferential enhancement of episodic memory
  - Inconsistent benefits in healthy volunteers
  - Requires monitoring for side effects

## Natural Nootropics

### Taurine
- **Mechanism**: Antioxidant activity and glutamate receptor modulation
- **Effects**: Neuroprotective properties
- **Research Data**:
  - 18% reduction in amyloid-β plaque density (animal studies)
  - Improved Y-maze performance
  - 2.5-point MMSE improvement in elderly AD patients
- **Considerations**:
  - Limited blood-brain barrier penetration
  - Mixed results in placebo-controlled trials
  - Better suited for long-term neuroprotection

### Tyrosine
- **Mechanism**: Dopamine precursor
- **Effects**: Stress resistance and cognitive maintenance
- **Research Data**:
  - Limited benefit in non-stressed states
  - Effective during sleep deprivation
  - No significant improvement in athletic performance
- **Considerations**:
  - Context-dependent efficacy
  - Most effective under acute stressors
  - Requires proper timing and dosing

### Herbal Compounds
- **Galantamine**:
  - Acetylcholinesterase inhibition
  - 1.9-point SIB score improvement
  - Functional gains in daily activities
- **Huperzine A**:
  - Selective acetylcholinesterase inhibition
  - 4.2-point ADAS-Cog improvement at 400 µg/day
  - 10–14 hour half-life requiring split dosing

## Mechanisms of Enhancement

### Cholinergic System
- Citicoline: 22% increase in cortical acetylcholine
- Oxiracetam: 15% improvement in processing speed
- AMPA receptor current potentiation

### Dopaminergic System
- Enhanced signal-to-noise ratios
- Stabilized cortical ensembles
- Improved task-switching accuracy

### Glutamatergic System
- Increased BDNF levels (34% with vortioxetine)
- Enhanced mTOR-mediated protein synthesis
- Improved hippocampal plasticity

## Safety and Monitoring

### Clinical Parameters
| Compound | Primary Mechanism | Cognitive Domain | Common Effects |
|----------|------------------|------------------|----------------|
| Methylphenidate | DAT/NET inhibition | Attention, working memory | Insomnia, BP changes |
| Bupropion | NDRI | Executive function | Seizure risk 0.1% |
| Vortioxetine | 5-HT modulation | Episodic memory | Nausea, dizziness |
| Taurine | Antioxidant | Neuroprotection | Minimal GI effects |

### Implementation Guidelines
- Regular monitoring of vital signs
- Cognitive performance tracking
- Side effect documentation
- Drug interaction screening
