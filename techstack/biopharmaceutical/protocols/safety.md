## Overview

This document outlines safety protocols, monitoring requirements, and risk management strategies for biopharmaceutical interventions.

## Safety Framework

### Core Principles
1. **Transparency**: Observable decision-making processes
2. **Accountability**: Clear responsibility chains
3. **Safety**: Robust containment mechanisms
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive record-keeping
5. **Monitoring**: Continuous assessment

## Risk Assessment

### Prescription Compounds
- **Methylphenidate**:
  - Cardiovascular monitoring
  - Sleep pattern tracking
  - Dose-dependent risk assessment
  - Drug interaction screening

- **Bupropion**:
  - Seizure risk monitoring (0.1% incidence)
  - Blood pressure tracking
  - Dopaminergic side effects
  - Withdrawal management

- **Vortioxetine**:
  - Serotonergic monitoring
  - Cognitive function assessment
  - Side effect documentation
  - Dose adjustment protocols

### Natural Compounds
- **Taurine**:
  - Long-term safety tracking
  - Biomarker monitoring
  - Interaction assessment
  - Quality control verification

- **Tyrosine**:
  - Stress response monitoring
  - Performance tracking
